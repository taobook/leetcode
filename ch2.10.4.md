# Shell Sort

The code you provided implements **Shell Sort**, which is an optimization over the Insertion Sort algorithm. Shell Sort works by first sorting elements far apart and progressively reducing the gap between elements being compared. This allows elements to move closer to their correct positions faster than a standard insertion sort.

### Explanation of Shell Sort:
- **Gap/Step**: It starts by comparing elements that are a certain number of steps apart (controlled by the variable `step`), progressively reducing this gap until it becomes `1` (when the algorithm behaves like insertion sort).
- **Inner Loop**: Once the gap is reduced to `1`, it finishes sorting the array like a standard insertion sort.

### How It Works:
1. **Initial Gap**: The first gap is typically half the length of the array (`length / 2`).
2. **Reduce the Gap**: On each iteration, the gap is reduced by half (`step /= 2`), and the elements that are `step` positions apart are compared and sorted.
3. **Insertion Sort on Subarrays**: For each gap value, the algorithm performs an insertion sort on the subarrays formed by picking every `step`th element.

Here’s an annotated version of your code:

```java
public static void sort(int[] arr) {
    int length = arr.length;
    int temp;

    // Outer loop: gradually reduce the gap between compared elements
    for (int step = length / 2; step >= 1; step /= 2) {
        // Start from the element at 'step' and go through the array
        for (int i = step; i < length; i++) {
            temp = arr[i]; // Store the current element for insertion
            int j = i - step; // Compare with elements 'step' positions apart

            // Shift elements until the correct position for 'temp' is found
            while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > temp) {
                arr[j + step] = arr[j]; // Shift element 'step' positions forward
                j -= step;
            }

            // Place 'temp' in the correct position
            arr[j + step] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of Key Parts:
1. **Gap Reduction**: `step /= 2` reduces the gap progressively until the gap becomes 1, which completes the sorting process with a final insertion sort.
2. **Insertion Sort within Gap**: The `while` loop shifts elements that are out of order (relative to the current gap) to their correct positions.
3. **Placement of Element**: Once a spot is found where `temp` should be placed, it's inserted at `arr[j + step]`.

### Example:
Let's take an array `[12, 34, 54, 2, 3]` and apply Shell Sort:
- **First Step (step = 2)**:
   - Compare `arr[0]` and `arr[2]`: No swap needed.
   - Compare `arr[1]` and `arr[3]`: Swap `34` and `2`.
   - Compare `arr[2]` and `arr[4]`: Swap `54` and `3`.
   - The array becomes `[12, 2, 3, 34, 54]`.
- **Second Step (step = 1)**:
   - Now it's similar to an insertion sort.
   - Compare and swap `2` and `12`.
   - Compare and swap `3` and `12`.
   - The final sorted array is `[2, 3, 12, 34, 54]`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Best-case complexity**: O(n log n), if the initial gap values allow elements to get close to their correct positions early.
- **Worst-case complexity**: O(n²), although in practice Shell Sort is much faster than Insertion Sort due to fewer shifts.
- **Average-case complexity**: Varies based on the gap sequence used. The original gap sequence used in this implementation (halving the gap) gives a time complexity closer to O(n³/²).

### Improvements:
Different **gap sequences** (like Hibbard’s, Sedgewick’s, or Pratt’s sequence) can improve Shell Sort’s performance. The gap sequence used in your implementation (`step = length / 2, step /= 2`) is one of the more common ones.
