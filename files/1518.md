            // Exchange empty bottles for full ones

}

This Java solution solves the problem of calculating how many total water bottles you can drink if you start with a certain number of full bottles and can exchange empty bottles for new full ones.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

### Problem:
You are given:
1. `numBottles`: the number of full water bottles you start with.
2. `numExchange`: the number of empty bottles required to exchange for a new full bottle.

The task is to determine how many total bottles of water you can drink, assuming that after drinking a full bottle, you have one empty bottle, and you can trade in empty bottles for full ones based on the `numExchange` rate.

### Approach:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `res`: Keeps track of the total number of bottles you have drunk.
   - `full`: Tracks the current number of full bottles you can drink.
   - `empty`: Tracks the current number of empty bottles you have after drinking.

2. **While Loop**:
   - While there are full bottles (`full > 0`), you:
     - Drink all the full bottles, increasing `res` by the number of `full` bottles.
     - Update `tmpEmpty` as the sum of the current full and empty bottles, which represents how many empty bottles you will have after drinking.
     - Exchange empty bottles for full ones. `full` becomes `tmpEmpty / numExchange` (the number of full bottles you can get by exchanging empty ones), and `empty` becomes `tmpEmpty % numExchange` (the leftover empty bottles).

3. **Loop Exit**:
   - The loop terminates when you no longer have any full bottles to drink (`full == 0`).

4. **Return Result**:
   - The result `res` is returned, which is the total number of bottles drunk.

### Example Walkthrough:

Suppose you start with 9 full bottles (`numBottles = 9`) and can exchange 3 empty bottles for 1 full bottle (`numExchange = 3`).

- Initially, `full = 9` and `empty = 0`.
- **First loop**: Drink 9 bottles, now `res = 9`. You have `9` empty bottles. Exchange 9 empty bottles for 3 full ones, so `full = 3`, `empty = 0`.
- **Second loop**: Drink 3 more bottles, now `res = 12`. You have `3` empty bottles. Exchange 3 empty bottles for 1 full one, so `full = 1`, `empty = 0`.
- **Third loop**: Drink 1 more bottle, now `res = 13`. You have `1` empty bottle. Since 1 empty bottle is not enough to exchange for a full one (`numExchange = 3`), the loop ends.

Thus, the total number of bottles drunk is 13.


### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(log(numBottles))** because in each loop, the number of full bottles is reduced by a factor of `numExchange`, and the loop terminates when `full == 0`.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since only a constant amount of extra space is used regardless of the input size.
