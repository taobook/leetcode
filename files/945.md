# 945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique | E-22

The provided code solves the problem of making an array's elements unique by performing the minimum number of increment operations. Let me break it down step by step and explain some key parts.

### Problem Explanation:

Given an array of integers, the task is to make all the elements unique. You can increment any element by 1 any number of times. The goal is to return the minimum number of increments needed to achieve uniqueness for all elements in the array.

### Code Breakdown:

#### 1. **Main Method**:
The main method contains two test cases:
```java
System.out.println(new Solution().minIncrementForUnique(new int[] {1, 2, 2}));
System.out.println(new Solution().minIncrementForUnique(new int[] {3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 7}));
```

These cases will call the `minIncrementForUnique` method to compute the number of increments required to make the array elements unique.

#### 2. **Finding the Maximum Value in the Array**:
```java
int max = 0;
for (int n : nums) {
    max = Math.max(max, n);
}
```
The variable `max` holds the largest element in the `nums` array. It helps to determine the size of the `count` array, which will be used to track the frequency of each element.

#### 3. **Creating a Count Array**:
```java
int[] count = new int[nums.length + max]; // Why this length?
```
The length of the `count` array is `nums.length + max`. The reason for this length is to accommodate all possible values that may result after increments. Since we may increment numbers beyond their original values, we need space for new potential values up to `max` plus the number of elements in the array.

#### 4. **Populating the Count Array**:
```java
for (int n : nums) {
    count[n]++;
}
```
This loop increments the count for each number in `nums`. The `count` array will store how many times each number appears.

#### 5. **Processing the Array for Uniqueness**:
This part handles finding and adjusting duplicate values.
```java
int res = 0;
int taken = 0;
int start = 0;

for (int n = 0; n < nums.length + max; n++) {
    if (count[n] >= 2) { // Not unique
        taken += count[n] - 1; // Count extra occurrences
        start += n * (count[n] - 1); // Option 1: Accumulate the starting point for later subtraction
    } else if (taken > 0 && count[n] == 0) { // Find empty slot
        taken--; // Decrement taken as we place one of the extra elements
        res += n; // Add the position to the result (this is equivalent to moving the extra element here)
    }
}
```

- **`taken`**: Tracks how many excess elements (duplicates) we need to place in new positions.
- **`start`**: Optionally accumulates the positions of extra elements for later subtraction (used for a different approach, not the main one in this code).
- **The main logic**:
    - If the current element `n` is found more than once (`count[n] >= 2`), the extra occurrences are added to `taken`.
    - If an empty position is found (`count[n] == 0`), one of the "taken" elements is moved here, and the result (`res`) is incremented by the current index `n` because this is the number of moves required to place the extra element in this empty spot.

#### 6. **Final Adjustment**:
```java
res -= start;
```
The variable `start` is used as an optimization to handle subtraction of positions for duplicated elements that are shifted. It's essentially adjusting the result because the original "taken" elements were initially counted into the result.

#### 7. **Return the Result**:
Finally, the result `res` contains the minimum number of increments required to make all elements unique.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let’s break down one example:

#### Input: `{1, 2, 2}`
1. **Step 1**: Count array: `[0, 1, 2]` → `1` appears once, `2` appears twice.
2. **Step 2**: Handle duplicate `2`:
    - Take one duplicate `2` and look for an empty spot.
    - First empty spot is `3`, so place the duplicate `2` there (one increment operation needed).
3. **Final Result**: `1 increment` is required to make the array unique.

#### Input: `{3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 7}`
1. **Step 1**: Count array: `[0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]` → `1` appears twice, `2` appears twice, `3` appears once, `7` appears once.
2. **Step 2**: Handle duplicate `1`:
    - Place one duplicate `1` in position `4` (3 increments needed).
3. **Step 3**: Handle duplicate `2`:
    - Place one duplicate `2` in position `5` (3 increments needed).
4. **Final Result**: `6 increments` are required to make the array unique.

### Summary:
The algorithm efficiently ensures that all elements in the array are unique by leveraging a count array and using a greedy approach to place duplicates in the nearest available positions. The time complexity is **O(n + k)**, where `n` is the number of elements and `k` is the maximum value in the array. The space complexity is **O(n + k)** due to the count array.

This solution solves the problem of finding the minimum number of increments required to make an array of integers `nums` have all unique elements. Here's an explanation for why the `count` array has the length `nums.length + max` and the rest of the logic:

### Explanation of `count` array size:

#### Why is the length `nums.length + max`?

- `max` represents the maximum value in the array `nums`.
- The length of `count[]` is `nums.length + max` because:
    1. The algorithm needs to track all numbers in the range from 0 to at least `max`. The `count[]` array is used to count occurrences of each number in the array `nums`.
    2. Since some values in `nums` may appear multiple times, the algorithm also needs room to accommodate any numbers that might result from the increment operations. In the worst case, each duplicate number could be incremented multiple times to go beyond the original `max` value, potentially up to `max + nums.length`.

  For example, if `nums` contains the number `max` repeated `k` times, then after incrementing all duplicates, the final array could have values up to `max + (k - 1)`.

#### Example:
If `nums = [3, 2, 2, 1]`, then:
- The maximum value `max = 3`.
- The size of `count[]` needs to accommodate increments that push numbers beyond `max`, so `count[]` is sized to `nums.length + max = 4 + 3 = 7`.

### Rest of the logic:

1. **Counting Occurrences**:
   ```java
   for (int n : nums) {
       count[n]++;
   }
   ```
   The `count` array keeps track of how many times each number appears in `nums`.

2. **Handling Duplicates**:
   ```java
   int res = 0;
   int taken = 0;
   for (int n = 0; n < nums.length + max; n++) {
       if (count[n] >= 2) {
           taken += count[n] - 1;
           res -= n * (count[n] - 1);
       } else if (taken > 0 && count[n] == 0) {
           taken--;
           res += n;
       }
   }
   ```
    - `count[n] >= 2`: If a number `n` appears more than once (i.e., it is not unique), the excess occurrences (`count[n] - 1`) need to be moved to higher values. The `taken` variable keeps track of these excess elements.
    - `res -= n * (count[n] - 1)`: Preemptively subtracts the cost of having to move these duplicates.
    - `else if (taken > 0 && count[n] == 0)`: If there are extra elements (`taken > 0`) and the current position `n` is available (i.e., `count[n] == 0`), the element is placed there, and the cost (`res`) is updated by adding `n`.

The overall idea is to preemptively subtract the cost of duplications and then adjust the result as the algorithm finds available spots to place the duplicates.
