# 1554. Strings Differ by One Character | M-194
Given a list of strings dict where all the strings are of the same length.
Return true if there are 2 strings that only differ by 1 character in the same index, otherwise return false.
Input: dict = ["abcd","acbd", "aacd"]
Output: true
Explanation: Strings "abcd" and "aacd" differ only by one character in the index 1.

```java

class Solution {
    public boolean differByOne(String[] dict) {
        if(dict == null || dict.length == 0) return false;
        Set<String> seen = new HashSet<>();

        for(int i = 0; i < dict.length; i++) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(dict[i]);
            for(int j = 0; j < dict[0].length(); j++) {
                //把每个字符替换成#
                char c = sb.charAt(j);
                sb.setCharAt(j, '#');
                String str = sb.toString();
                if(!seen.add(str)) return true;
                sb.setCharAt(j, c);
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

This solution efficiently determines whether two strings in the given array `dict` differ by exactly one character. The idea is to replace each character in every string with a placeholder (`#`), generating a new string that represents the pattern of that word with one missing character. If any two strings share the same pattern after replacing one character, it means that these two strings differ by only that one character.

### Explanation of the Algorithm:

1. **Edge Case**:
    - If `dict` is `null` or empty, the method returns `false` since there are no strings to compare.

2. **Set to Track Patterns**:
    - A `HashSet` (`seen`) is used to store the transformed strings (those with one character replaced by `#`). The goal is to see if the transformed version of any string already exists in the set, which would indicate that another string differs from it by just one character.

3. **Iterating Through Each String**:
    - For each string in the array `dict`, it creates a new string by replacing one character at a time with the character `#`. This creates a pattern that omits one character in the string.
    - After creating this new pattern, the algorithm checks if it already exists in the set. If it does, it means that another string has the same pattern, so they must differ by exactly one character.
    - If the pattern is not already in the set, it is added to the set and the loop continues.

4. **Returning the Result**:
    - If any two strings share the same pattern, the function returns `true`, indicating that they differ by exactly one character.
    - If after checking all strings no matching pattern is found, it returns `false`.

### Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean differByOne(String[] dict) {
        if (dict == null || dict.length == 0) return false;
        Set<String> seen = new HashSet<>();

        // Iterate through each string in the dictionary
        for (int i = 0; i < dict.length; i++) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(dict[i]);
            // For each character position, replace it with '#' to generate patterns
            for (int j = 0; j < dict[0].length(); j++) {
                char c = sb.charAt(j);
                sb.setCharAt(j, '#');  // Replace the character at position j with '#'
                String str = sb.toString();  // Create the pattern string

                // Check if this pattern was already seen, return true if so
                if (!seen.add(str)) return true;
                
                // Restore the character back to its original value
                sb.setCharAt(j, c);
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Example Walkthrough:

Suppose `dict = ["abc", "acc", "abcd"]`:
1. For `"abc"`, we generate the patterns: `"#bc"`, `"a#c"`, and `"ab#"`.
    - All patterns are added to `seen`.
2. For `"acc"`, we generate the patterns: `"#cc"`, `"a#c"`, and `"ac#"`.
    - The pattern `"a#c"` is already in the set, which means that `"abc"` and `"acc"` differ by only one character. Thus, the function will return `true`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of strings in the array and `m` is the length of each string.
    - Each string is processed, and for each string, every character is replaced once, leading to `m` transformations for each string.

- **Space complexity**: `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the length of the strings.
    - The `HashSet` may store up to `n * m` patterns, but since each pattern has `m-1` characters (with one `#`), the space usage depends on the number of distinct patterns generated.
