# 189. Rotate Array | M-362

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k %= nums.length;
        reverse(nums,0, nums.length-1);
        reverse(nums,0,k-1);
        reverse(nums,k,nums.length-1);
    }

    private void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while(start<end){
            int t = nums[start];
            nums[start]=nums[end];
            nums[end]=t;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
The code you've posted is a Java solution to rotate an array `nums` by `k` positions to the right. Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:

### Steps in the Algorithm:

1. **Adjust `k`:**
   ```java
   k %= nums.length;
   ```
   This handles cases where `k` is larger than the length of the array. For example, if the array has length 5 and `k = 7`, rotating the array by 7 positions is equivalent to rotating it by 2 positions (because `7 % 5 = 2`).

2. **Reverse the Entire Array:**
   ```java
   reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
   ```
   The array is first reversed completely. For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it becomes `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

3. **Reverse the First Part (0 to k-1):**
   ```java
   reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
   ```
   The first `k` elements are reversed. After this step, the first `k` elements of the array are in their correct rotated position. For example, if `k = 2`, the array becomes `[4, 5, 3, 2, 1]`.

4. **Reverse the Remaining Part (k to end):**
   ```java
   reverse(nums, k, nums.length - 1);
   ```
   Finally, the remaining part of the array is reversed. After this step, the array becomes fully rotated to the right by `k` positions. Continuing with the above example, the array would become `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.

### Example:

Letâ€™s say `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 3`. Here's how the algorithm processes it:

- First, adjust `k` if necessary (`k %= nums.length`), but in this case, `k = 3` remains the same.
- Reverse the entire array:  
  `[7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
- Reverse the first `k` elements (from index 0 to `k-1`):  
  `[5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
- Reverse the rest of the array (from index `k` to the end):  
  `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

Now the array is rotated by 3 positions to the right.

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. Each reversal takes linear time.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since the array is modified in place without using any extra space.

This is an efficient and commonly used approach to solve the array rotation problem.
