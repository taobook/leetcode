# 163. Missing Ranges

Given a sorted integer array where the range of elements are [0, 99] inclusive, return its missing ranges.

> For example, given [0, 1, 3, 50, 75], lower = 0 and upper = 99,
return [“2”, “4->49”, “51->74”, “76->99”]

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> findMissingRanges(int[] nums, int lower, int upper) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();

        int prev = lower-1;
        for(int i=0;i<=nums.length;i++){
            int curr = i<nums.length?nums[i]:upper+1;//{ prev, [prev+1, curr-1] curr }
            if(prev+1 <= curr-1) {
                res.add(prev+1==curr-1?String.valueOf(prev+1):(prev+1)+"->"+(curr-1));
            }
            prev = curr;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The code you provided is an implementation of a method to find missing ranges in a sorted array of integers, given a lower and upper bound. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - A list `res` is created to store the missing ranges as strings.
   - The variable `prev` is initialized to `lower - 1`. This keeps track of the last number we processed.

2. **Iteration through the array**:
   - A loop runs from `0` to `nums.length`. This allows checking for missing ranges both within the array and after the last element.
   - Inside the loop, `curr` is determined:
     - If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, `curr` takes the value of `nums[i]`.
     - If `i` equals `nums.length`, `curr` is set to `upper + 1` to handle the case after the last number in the array.

3. **Finding Missing Ranges**:
   - It checks if there is a range missing between `prev` and `curr` using the condition `prev + 1 <= curr - 1`.
   - If there is exactly one missing number (`prev + 1 == curr - 1`), it adds just that number to `res`.
   - If there is a range of missing numbers, it adds a string representation of that range in the format `start->end`.

4. **Updating `prev`**:
   - `prev` is updated to `curr` for the next iteration.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the list of missing ranges is returned.

### Example
For example, if `nums = [0, 1, 3, 50, 75]`, `lower = 0`, and `upper = 99`, the output would be:
```
["2", "4->49", "51->74", "76->99"]
```

### Code Improvement
While the code is quite clean, you might consider adding comments for clarity, especially in collaborative environments. Here's the same code with added comments:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> findMissingRanges(int[] nums, int lower, int upper) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();

        int prev = lower - 1; // Initialize previous number to one less than lower
        for (int i = 0; i <= nums.length; i++) {
            // Determine the current number; handle the case after the last element
            int curr = i < nums.length ? nums[i] : upper + 1;

            // Check if there is a missing range between prev and curr
            if (prev + 1 <= curr - 1) {
                // If only one number is missing
                res.add(prev + 1 == curr - 1 ? String.valueOf(prev + 1) : (prev + 1) + "->" + (curr - 1));
            }
            prev = curr; // Update prev for the next iteration
        }
        return res; // Return the list of missing ranges
    }
}
```

This version retains the original logic but makes the intent clearer with comments.


This solution efficiently handles all edge cases and returns the correct missing ranges between lower and upper.
