# 1213. Intersection of Three Sorted Arrays | M-191

This code defines a solution to find the intersection of three sorted arrays. The goal is to return a list of elements that are common to all three arrays. Since the arrays are sorted, an efficient approach is to use three pointers to traverse each array simultaneously.

### How the code works:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Three pointers `i`, `j`, and `k` are initialized to `0`, representing the starting index for each of the three arrays `arr1`, `arr2`, and `arr3`, respectively.
    - An empty list `res` is used to store the common elements found in all three arrays.

2. **Iterating through the arrays**:
    - The algorithm uses a `while` loop to simultaneously traverse all three arrays as long as the pointers are within bounds.
    - For each step:
        - It checks if `arr1[i] == arr2[j] == arr3[k]`. If true, this means the current element is common to all three arrays, so it is added to the result list `res`. After that, all three pointers (`i`, `j`, and `k`) are incremented.
        - If `arr1[i]` is smaller than `arr2[j]`, it means the smallest element is in `arr1`, so the pointer `i` is incremented to check the next element in `arr1`.
        - If `arr2[j]` is smaller than `arr3[k]`, then pointer `j` is incremented to check the next element in `arr2`.
        - Otherwise, `arr3[k]` must be smaller, so pointer `k` is incremented to check the next element in `arr3`.

3. **Return the result**:
    - Once any of the pointers exceeds the bounds of its respective array, the loop terminates and the result list `res` is returned.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n1 + n2 + n3)**, where `n1`, `n2`, and `n3` are the lengths of the three arrays `arr1`, `arr2`, and `arr3`, respectively. This is because each element in each array is visited at most once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m)**, where `m` is the number of common elements in the result list `res`.

### Example:

#### Example 1:
```java
Input:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [1, 2, 5, 7, 9]
arr3 = [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]

Output:
[1, 5]
```

#### Step-by-step Explanation:
- Start with `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `k = 0`.
    - `arr1[i] = 1`, `arr2[j] = 1`, `arr3[k] = 1` → all are equal, add `1` to `res`, increment all pointers: `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `k = 1`.
- Now, `arr1[i] = 2`, `arr2[j] = 2`, `arr3[k] = 3`.
    - `arr1[i] < arr3[k]`, so increment `i`: `i = 2`.
- Now, `arr1[i] = 3`, `arr2[j] = 2`, `arr3[k] = 3`.
    - `arr2[j] < arr3[k]`, so increment `j`: `j = 2`.
- Now, `arr1[i] = 3`, `arr2[j] = 5`, `arr3[k] = 3`.
    - `arr1[i] < arr2[j]`, so increment `i`: `i = 3`.
- Now, `arr1[i] = 4`, `arr2[j] = 5`, `arr3[k] = 3`.
    - `arr3[k] < arr1[i]`, so increment `k`: `k = 2`.
- Now, `arr1[i] = 4`, `arr2[j] = 5`, `arr3[k] = 4`.
    - `arr1[i] == arr3[k]`, but `arr2[j]` is larger, so increment `i`: `i = 4`.
- Now, `arr1[i] = 5`, `arr2[j] = 5`, `arr3[k] = 5` → all are equal, add `5` to `res`, increment all pointers.
- End of the loop, return `[1, 5]`.

### Optimized Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> arraysIntersection(int[] arr1, int[] arr2, int[] arr3) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0; // Initialize three pointers

        // Traverse through all three arrays
        while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length && k < arr3.length) {
            // If all three elements are equal, add to result and move all pointers
            if (arr1[i] == arr2[j] && arr1[i] == arr3[k]) {
                res.add(arr1[i]);
                i++;
                j++;
                k++;
            }
            // If arr1[i] is the smallest, increment i
            else if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
                i++;
            }
            // If arr2[j] is the smallest, increment j
            else if (arr2[j] < arr3[k]) {
                j++;
            }
            // Otherwise, increment k
            else {
                k++;
            }
        }

        return res; // Return the list of common elements
    }
}
```

This method effectively finds the common elements of three sorted arrays with linear time complexity. The use of the three-pointer technique leverages the fact that the arrays are already sorted, minimizing the need for unnecessary comparisons.
