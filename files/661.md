This solution implements a sliding window technique to smooth the image, where the average value of each pixel is calculated by considering the values of neighboring pixels within a 3x3 window. The key idea is to maintain and reuse the results of previously computed columns to reduce redundant calculations, thus improving efficiency.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Image Smoother**:
    - For each pixel at position `(i, j)`, the smoothed value is the average of itself and its neighboring pixels (up to 8 neighbors).
    - If any of these neighbors are out of bounds (e.g., edge pixels), they are ignored during the calculation.

2. **Sliding Window**:
    - To avoid recalculating values for neighboring pixels from scratch, the solution uses three "columns" (left, middle, and right) that represent the sum and count of valid pixels in the current 3x3 window. These columns are shifted as the window moves across the matrix.
    - The `calcCol` helper method is responsible for calculating the sum and count of valid pixels for a given column (and its neighboring rows).

### Code Explanation:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] imageSmoother(int[][] img) {
        int[] leftCol = null;  // Stores the sum and count for the left column of the window
        int[] midCol = null;   // Stores the sum and count for the middle column of the window
        int[] rightCol = null; // Stores the sum and count for the right column of the window

        int[][] res = new int[img.length][img[0].length];  // Result matrix for the smoothed image

        for (int i = 0; i < img.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < img[0].length; j++) {
                int sum = 0;
                int count = 0;

                // Calculate the three columns at the start of each row
                if (j == 0) {
                    leftCol = calcCol(img, j - 1, i - 1, i + 1);   // Left column (j-1)
                    midCol = calcCol(img, j, i - 1, i + 1);        // Middle column (j)
                    rightCol = calcCol(img, j + 1, i - 1, i + 1);  // Right column (j+1)
                } else {  // For subsequent columns, only calculate the next right column
                    rightCol = calcCol(img, j + 1, i - 1, i + 1);
                }

                // Compute the total sum and count from the three columns
                sum = leftCol[0] + midCol[0] + rightCol[0];
                count = leftCol[1] + midCol[1] + rightCol[1];

                // Calculate the average for the current pixel and store it in the result
                res[i][j] = sum / count;

                // Move the window: shift the columns to the left
                leftCol = midCol;
                midCol = rightCol;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }

    // Helper method to calculate the sum and count of valid pixels in a column
    private int[] calcCol(int[][] img, int col, int topRow, int bottomRow) {
        int[] res = new int[2];  // res[0] = sum, res[1] = count
        if (col < 0 || col >= img[0].length) return res;  // Out of bounds check

        for (int i = topRow; i <= bottomRow; i++) {
            if (i >= 0 && i < img.length) {  // Valid row check
                res[0] += img[i][col];  // Sum of the pixel values in the column
                res[1]++;               // Count of valid pixels in the column
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

### Key Steps:
1. **Initialize `leftCol`, `midCol`, and `rightCol`**:
    - The algorithm maintains three columns at any given time, representing the current 3x3 window.
    - These columns are recalculated only as necessary (i.e., when moving to a new column).

2. **Sliding Window**:
    - For the first column (`j == 0`) of each row, all three columns (left, middle, right) are calculated using the `calcCol` method.
    - For subsequent columns (`j > 0`), only the next right column is recalculated, and the left and middle columns are shifted.

3. **Computing Average**:
    - The sum and count of valid pixels in the current 3x3 window are computed from the three columns.
    - The average value is calculated by dividing the sum by the count and stored in the result matrix.

4. **Boundary Handling**:
    - The `calcCol` method ensures that invalid columns (e.g., when `col < 0` or `col >= img[0].length`) are skipped.
    - Similarly, invalid rows are ignored inside the column calculation, ensuring proper boundary handling.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. Each pixel is processed once, and each column is calculated once per row. The sliding window approach ensures that the algorithm avoids redundant calculations.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n)** for storing the result matrix.
- Additional space is used for the `leftCol`, `midCol`, and `rightCol` arrays, but this is a fixed size (constant space) relative to the input matrix dimensions.

### Example:

#### Input:
```plaintext
img = [
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 1]
]
```

#### Process:
- For each pixel, the algorithm calculates the sum and count of valid neighboring pixels (including the pixel itself) and then stores the average value.

#### Output:
```plaintext
res = [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]
```

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Pixel Matrix**: The smoothing process still works as the single pixel is considered by itself.
2. **Non-Square Matrices**: The algorithm handles matrices of any size, whether rectangular or square.
3. **Edge and Corner Pixels**: These pixels have fewer neighbors, and the algorithm correctly adjusts the sum and count for boundary conditions.

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently smooths the image by leveraging a sliding window approach and calculating the average values for each pixel based on its neighbors. The use of columns to represent the current window helps reduce redundant calculations, making the algorithm more efficient for large matrices. The algorithm also handles edge cases such as boundary pixels and out-of-bound neighbors properly.
