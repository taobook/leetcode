        //以标准化后的字符串作为key
        Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();

            //始终将第一个字符映射到a
            chars[0] = 'a';

The problem **249. Group Shifted Strings** involves grouping strings that can be "shifted" into one another. Two strings are considered shifted versions of each other if, when shifting each character in one string by a constant amount (mod 26), we can obtain the other string. For example, `"abc"` can be shifted to `"bcd"`, and `"xyz"` can be shifted to `"yza"`.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Shifting**: A string can be "shifted" by incrementing the value of each character by a fixed number, modulo 26 (wrap-around from 'z' to 'a').
2. **Grouping**: We need to group all strings that can be shifted versions of each other.

### Approach

- **Standardization**: To identify shifted groups, we can map each string to a "base" form that normalizes the string by shifting it such that its first character becomes `'a'`. All other characters are shifted accordingly.
- **Key Generation**: For each string, we compute a "base" key:
    - We shift the first character to `'a'`.
    - Then, for each subsequent character, we calculate its relative position as if it were shifted by the same amount as the first character.
    - The normalized string is used as a key to group all strings that share the same shifting pattern.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Iterate through each string**.
2. For each string:
    - Calculate how much the first character needs to be shifted to become `'a'`.
    - Apply the same shift to all subsequent characters, keeping the transformation within the bounds of 'a' to 'z' using modulo arithmetic.
    - Use the resulting shifted string as a key to group the original strings.
3. Collect all groups and return them as the result.

### Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupStrings(String[] strings) {
        // Map to group strings by their standardized key
        Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Iterate through each string
        for (String string : strings) {
            char[] chars = string.toCharArray();
            // Calculate the offset of the first character from 'a'
            int diff = chars[0] - 'a';
            
            // Normalize the string by shifting the first character to 'a'
            chars[0] = 'a';
            
            // Shift the rest of the characters accordingly
            for (int i = 1; i < chars.length; i++) {
                char n = (char) (chars[i] - diff);
                
                // If the character goes out of bounds (below 'a'), wrap it around
                if (n < 'a') {
                    n += 26;
                }
                chars[i] = n;
            }
            
            // Convert the normalized char array back to a string (base key)
            String base = new String(chars);
            
            // Group strings by their base key
            map.putIfAbsent(base, new ArrayList<>());
            map.get(base).add(string);
        }
        
        // Collect all groups into the result list
        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Map Creation**:
    - We use a `HashMap<String, List<String>>` to store groups of strings that share the same base key (standardized form).

2. **Standardization Process**:
    - For each string, calculate the difference between its first character and `'a'`. This difference is used to shift the rest of the characters in the string.
    - If shifting results in a character going below `'a'`, we wrap it around using `+26` to ensure it stays within 'a' to 'z'.

3. **Group the Strings**:
    - If a string's base form is already in the map, add it to the corresponding group. Otherwise, create a new group.

4. **Result Construction**:
    - After processing all strings, we extract the grouped lists from the map and return them.

### Example Test Case:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        String[] strings1 = {"abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"};
        System.out.println(sol.groupStrings(strings1));
        // Expected output: [["abc","bcd","xyz"],["acef"],["az","ba"],["a","z"]]
        
        String[] strings2 = {"a", "b", "ab", "bc", "za"};
        System.out.println(sol.groupStrings(strings2));
        // Expected output: [["a","b"], ["ab","bc"], ["za"]]
    }
}
```

### Edge Cases:

1. **Single Character Strings**: Strings like `"a"` and `"z"` should be grouped together since they can be considered shifted versions of each other.
2. **Strings of Different Lengths**: Strings of different lengths cannot be shifted versions of each other, so they will form separate groups.
3. **Handling Wrapping**: Ensure that characters wrap around correctly when shifted. For example, shifting `'z'` to `'a'` needs to be handled correctly.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \times L)\), where \(N\) is the number of strings, and \(L\) is the average length of each string. For each string, we are iterating through all its characters.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N \times L)\) because we are storing each string in a map as a key-value pair, where the value is a list of strings.

This approach efficiently groups shifted strings using normalization and modular arithmetic.
