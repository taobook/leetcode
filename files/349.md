### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] intersection(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int n : nums1) set.add(n);
        Set<Integer> inters = new HashSet<>();
        for (int n : nums2) if (set.contains(n)) inters.add(n);
        int[] res = new int[inters.size()];
        int index = 0;
        for (int n : inters) res[index++] = n;
        return res;
    }
}
```

The code you've provided is a solution for finding the intersection of two integer arrays. The approach uses two sets to handle duplicates and efficiently find the common elements between the two arrays. Here's a detailed explanation of how the solution works:

### Steps in the Algorithm:

1. **Create a Set from the First Array (`nums1`):**
   ```java
   Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
   for(int n : nums1) set.add(n);
   ```
   The first step is to store all elements of `nums1` in a `HashSet`. This removes duplicates from `nums1` and allows for constant time lookups.

2. **Find Common Elements:**
   ```java
   Set<Integer> inters = new HashSet<>();
   for(int n : nums2) if(set.contains(n)) inters.add(n);
   ```
   For each element in `nums2`, the code checks if that element is present in the `set` (which contains elements from `nums1`). If it is, the element is added to another `HashSet` called `inters`. The use of a `HashSet` for `inters` ensures that the result will also not contain any duplicates.

3. **Convert the Set to an Array:**
   ```java
   int[] res = new int[inters.size()];
   int index = 0;
   for(int n : inters) res[index++] = n;
   ```
   Finally, the common elements stored in the `inters` set are copied into an integer array `res`. Since the size of the array is exactly the same as the size of `inters`, this avoids any extra unused space.

4. **Return the Result:**
   ```java
   return res;
   ```
   The array containing the intersection of `nums1` and `nums2` is returned.

### Example:

Letâ€™s go through an example to understand the code better:

Suppose `nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]` and `nums2 = [2, 2]`.

- **Step 1:** Store all elements of `nums1` in a set:
  ```java
  set = {1, 2}
  ```

- **Step 2:** Iterate over `nums2` and find the common elements:
    - The first element `2` is found in the set, so it is added to the `inters` set:
      ```java
      inters = {2}
      ```
    - The second element `2` is also found, but since `inters` is a set, it will not add duplicates.

- **Step 3:** Convert the `inters` set to an array:
  ```java
  res = [2]
  ```

- **Step 4:** Return the array:
  ```java
  return [2]
  ```

The intersection of the two arrays is `[2]`.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time complexity:**
    - Creating the `set` from `nums1` takes \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of `nums1`.
    - Checking if elements of `nums2` are in `set` takes \( O(m) \), where \( m \) is the length of `nums2`.
    - Overall, the time complexity is \( O(n + m) \), where \( n \) and \( m \) are the lengths of the two arrays.

- **Space complexity:**
    - The space complexity is \( O(n + m) \), because two sets (`set` and `inters`) are used, which can each store up to \( n \) and \( m \) elements, respectively.

### Optimized Approach:
This approach is efficient in terms of both time and space. It avoids the need for sorting the arrays (which would take \( O(n \log n + m \log m) \)) and provides a simple yet optimal solution using sets for constant-time lookups.

This solution will work well even for large arrays, making it a solid choice for solving the intersection problem.
