This implementation solves the problem of finding the **longest duplicate substring** in a given string using **Rabin-Karp with polynomial rolling hash** and **binary search**.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**:
    - Rabin-Karp is a popular string matching algorithm that uses hashing to search for a pattern in a text. By converting substrings to hashes, comparisons can be done in constant time.
    - In this case, the algorithm is used to search for a substring of a given length that appears at least twice in the input string.

2. **Binary Search**:
    - The algorithm performs a binary search on the length of the substring. The goal is to find the maximum length `L` such that a substring of length `L` occurs more than once in the string.
    - Binary search efficiently narrows down the range of possible lengths.

3. **Rolling Hash**:
    - The rolling hash function is used to compute the hash of a substring of length `L` in constant time (`O(1)`), which improves the efficiency of the search process.
    - This allows efficient sliding window processing where substrings can be compared using their hash values.

### Code Explanation:

#### 1. `longestDupSubstring` Method:
This method implements the overall approach. It starts by converting the input string into an integer array `nums`, where each character is represented as an integer between 0 and 25 (`'a' = 0, 'b' = 1`, and so on). The integer array is then used to compute hash values for substrings.

The binary search is used to find the longest repeating substring:
- The search range is between `1` (the smallest possible length) and `n` (the length of the string).
- For each length `L` in the binary search, the `search` method is called to check if a repeating substring of that length exists.

#### 2. `search` Method:
The `search` method computes the rolling hash for all substrings of length `L`. For each new substring, it:
- Computes its hash value.
- Checks if this hash value has been seen before.
- If the hash value was seen before, it compares the current substring with previously seen substrings to confirm if they are the same.

The method uses a **modulus** value to avoid overflow and ensures that the hash values remain within a manageable range.

#### 3. Hashing and Rolling Hash Update:
The rolling hash is updated in constant time for each new substring:
- The hash of the previous substring is multiplied by the base `a` and the character at the start of the previous substring is subtracted.
- The new character at the end of the current substring is added.
- This rolling update allows us to efficiently compute the hash of each substring in `O(1)`.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)`. The binary search runs in `O(log n)` iterations. In each iteration, the rolling hash computation takes `O(n)`, resulting in an overall complexity of `O(n log n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`. The algorithm uses additional space for storing the integer array `nums` and the `seen` hash map, both of which scale linearly with the size of the input string.

### Example:

```java
String s = "banana";
Solution sol = new Solution();
String result = sol.longestDupSubstring(s); // returns "ana"
```

For the input `"banana"`, the longest duplicate substring is `"ana"`, which occurs twice. The algorithm efficiently identifies this using binary search and the rolling hash technique.
