# 896. Monotonic Array | M-80 | v

This code defines a solution to the problem of checking whether an array is **monotonic**, meaning the array is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.

### How the code works:

1. **Initialize a variable `inc`**:
    - This variable tracks the "direction" of the array:
        - `inc = 1`: Indicates the array is increasing.
        - `inc = -1`: Indicates the array is decreasing.
        - `inc = 0`: No trend has been established yet.

2. **Iterate through the array**:
    - Starting from the second element (`i = 1`), compare each element with the previous one:
        - If the current element `nums[i]` is greater than the previous one (`nums[i-1]`), check if the array was previously decreasing (`inc == -1`). If so, return `false` because the array can't be both increasing and decreasing.
        - If the current element `nums[i]` is smaller than the previous one, check if the array was previously increasing (`inc == 1`). Again, if that's the case, return `false`.
    - Update `inc` based on whether the current pair of elements shows an increase or decrease.

3. **Return `true`**:
    - If no conflicting trends are found (both increasing and decreasing), the array is monotonic, and the function returns `true`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array. The algorithm only makes a single pass through the array.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)** since only a few extra variables are used regardless of the size of the input array.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let’s consider a few examples to understand how the algorithm works:

#### Example 1:
Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3]`
- The array is increasing or flat.
- As we loop through the array:
    - At `i=1`, `nums[1] > nums[0]` → set `inc = 1`.
    - At `i=2`, `nums[2] == nums[1]` → no change to `inc`.
    - At `i=3`, `nums[3] > nums[2]` → `inc` remains `1`.
- Result: Monotonic, so return `true`.

#### Example 2:
Input: `[6, 5, 4, 4]`
- The array is decreasing or flat.
- As we loop through the array:
    - At `i=1`, `nums[1] < nums[0]` → set `inc = -1`.
    - At `i=2`, `nums[2] < nums[1]` → `inc` remains `-1`.
    - At `i=3`, `nums[3] == nums[2]` → no change to `inc`.
- Result: Monotonic, so return `true`.

#### Example 3:
Input: `[1, 3, 2]`
- The array is not monotonic.
- As we loop through the array:
    - At `i=1`, `nums[1] > nums[0]` → set `inc = 1`.
    - At `i=2`, `nums[2] < nums[1]` → Since `inc = 1`, this indicates a decreasing trend after an increasing one, so return `false`.

### Optimized Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isMonotonic(int[] nums) {
        int inc = 0; // 1: increasing, -1: decreasing
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                if (inc == -1) return false; // if previously decreasing, return false
                inc = 1; // set trend to increasing
            } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                if (inc == 1) return false; // if previously increasing, return false
                inc = -1; // set trend to decreasing
            }
        }
        return true; // if no conflicts found, the array is monotonic
    }
}
```

This method is efficient and ensures that the array is checked for monotonicity in linear time with constant space.
