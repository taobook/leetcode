# 766. Toeplitz Matrix | M-47

```java
//判断是否右斜线相同
class Solution {
    public boolean isToeplitzMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        for(int i=1;i<matrix.length;i++) {
            for(int j=1;j<matrix[0].length;j++){
                if(matrix[i][j]!=matrix[i-1][j-1]) return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

The solution provided checks if a given matrix is a Toeplitz matrix. In a Toeplitz matrix, every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right contains the same elements. This means that for every element at position `(i, j)`, it must be equal to the element at `(i-1, j-1)` if both indices are within the bounds of the matrix.

### Explanation of Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isToeplitzMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        // Iterate through each element starting from the second row and second column
        for(int i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
                // Check if the current element is equal to the element diagonally above-left
                if(matrix[i][j] != matrix[i-1][j-1]) {
                    return false; // If not, the matrix is not Toeplitz
                }
            }
        }
        return true; // All diagonals are consistent, so the matrix is Toeplitz
    }
}
```

### How It Works:
1. **Outer Loop** (`for(int i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++)`):
    - Starts from the second row (`i = 1`) because the first row doesn't have a diagonal element above it.

2. **Inner Loop** (`for(int j = 1; j < matrix[0].length; j++)`):
    - Starts from the second column (`j = 1`) because the first column doesn't have a diagonal element to its left.

3. **Comparison** (`if(matrix[i][j] != matrix[i-1][j-1])`):
    - Compares the current element (`matrix[i][j]`) with the element to its top-left diagonal (`matrix[i-1][j-1]`).
    - If any mismatch is found, it returns `false`, indicating that the matrix is not a Toeplitz matrix.

4. **Return Statement**:
    - If all diagonal checks pass without mismatch, the function returns `true`, indicating that the matrix is Toeplitz.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: Where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. Every element is checked once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the matrix:

```
matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 1, 2],
  [5, 4, 1]
]
```

- The algorithm checks:
    - `matrix[1][1] == matrix[0][0]` (i.e., `1 == 1`)
    - `matrix[1][2] == matrix[0][1]` (i.e., `2 == 2`)
    - `matrix[2][1] == matrix[1][0]` (i.e., `4 == 4`)
    - `matrix[2][2] == matrix[1][1]` (i.e., `1 == 1`)

Since all diagonal checks are valid, the function returns `true`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Row or Column**:
    - A matrix with only one row or one column is always Toeplitz since there are no diagonals to check.

2. **Empty Matrix**:
    - An empty matrix or a matrix with no elements trivially satisfies the Toeplitz condition.

3. **Non-Square Matrix**:
    - This solution works for both square and non-square matrices. It checks diagonals in the same way regardless of matrix shape.

### Conclusion:
The solution correctly and efficiently determines if a matrix is a Toeplitz matrix by checking if each element is equal to the element diagonally above and to the left. The algorithm handles a variety of matrix sizes and shapes.
