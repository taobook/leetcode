In the provided class `Solution`, there are two methods, `minOperations` and `minOperations2`, both of which calculate the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the root directory from a given set of log operations.

### Method 1: `minOperations`
This method uses an integer variable `res` as a counter to track the current depth of directories. Here is how it works:

1. It loops over each string `log` in the `logs` array.
2. If the `log` is `"../"`, it checks if `res` (the depth) is greater than 0, and if so, it decreases `res` by 1, meaning it goes up one directory level.
3. If the `log` is `"./"`, nothing happens since this operation means "stay in the current directory."
4. Otherwise (i.e., for directory names like `"dir/"`), it increments `res` by 1, indicating moving deeper into the directory.

At the end of the loop, the variable `res` will hold the minimum number of operations required to return to the root.

### Method 2: `minOperations2`
This method uses a stack (`Deque<String>`) to simulate the directory navigation process.

1. It iterates through each string `log` in the `logs` array.
2. If the `log` is `"../"`, it pops the stack (if it is not empty), simulating going back up one directory.
3. If the `log` is `"./"`, it does nothing because this means "stay in the current directory."
4. Otherwise, it pushes the `log` onto the stack, indicating that we have entered a new directory.

At the end of the iteration, the size of the stack will indicate how deep we are in the directory structure. This size represents the number of steps to return to the root.

### Key Differences:

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - `minOperations` uses a constant amount of extra space (`O(1)`).
  - `minOperations2` uses a stack, which can grow linearly based on the number of directories visited, leading to an `O(n)` space complexity, where `n` is the number of valid directory entries (excluding `../` and `./`).

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Both methods have a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of logs, since they both loop through the `logs` array once.

### Which is Better?

- If minimizing space complexity is important, then `minOperations` is the better choice because it only uses an integer counter to track the current state.
- If you prefer a more explicit simulation of the directory stack (and don't mind the extra space), `minOperations2` is also a valid solution, especially since it closely resembles how the directory structure behaves.

Both methods correctly solve the problem, and the choice between them depends on the space requirements and readability preferences.
