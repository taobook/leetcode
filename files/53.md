The code you've provided is a solution to the **Maximum Subarray Problem**, which aims to find the largest sum of a contiguous subarray within a given array of integers. This is a classic problem that can be solved efficiently using **Kadane's Algorithm**.

### Explanation of the Algorithm:

1. **Initialization:**
   ```java
   int res = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
   int sum = 0;
   ```
    - `res` is initialized to the smallest possible integer value (`Integer.MIN_VALUE`) to keep track of the maximum subarray sum found so far.
    - `sum` is initialized to 0 and will accumulate the running sum of the current subarray.

2. **Iterating through the Array:**
   ```java
   for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
       sum += nums[i];
       res = Math.max(res, sum);
       if(sum < 0) sum = 0;
   }
   ```
    - In each iteration, the current element (`nums[i]`) is added to the `sum`.
    - The result `res` is updated to the maximum of the current `res` and the running sum (`sum`). This ensures that `res` always holds the maximum subarray sum found so far.
    - If the running sum `sum` becomes negative, it is reset to 0. This is because any negative sum will decrease the value of future subarrays. By resetting `sum` to 0, the algorithm effectively starts a new subarray.

3. **Return the Result:**
   ```java
   return res;
   ```
   After iterating through the entire array, `res` contains the maximum subarray sum, which is returned.

### How Kadane’s Algorithm Works:
Kadane’s algorithm works by maintaining a running sum of the current subarray and keeping track of the maximum sum encountered. The key idea is to reset the sum to 0 when it becomes negative, as continuing with a negative sum would only hurt the potential for finding a larger sum.

### Example:

Let’s consider an example `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`.

- Start with `sum = 0` and `res = Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
- Iterate through the array:
    - `sum = -2`, `res = -2`
    - `sum = 1`, `res = 1` (reset sum to 1 because 1 is larger)
    - `sum = -2` (reset sum to 0 because it became negative)
    - `sum = 4`, `res = 4`
    - `sum = 3`, `res = 4`
    - `sum = 5`, `res = 5`
    - `sum = 6`, `res = 6`
    - `sum = 1` (reset sum to 1 after adding `-5`)
    - `sum = 5`, `res = 6`

The largest subarray sum is 6, and the corresponding subarray is `[4, -1, 2, 1]`.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm makes a single pass through the array.

- **Space complexity:** \( O(1) \), because the algorithm only uses a few variables (`res` and `sum`) and does not require any additional space proportional to the input size.

### Optimized Solution:
This solution is already optimal in terms of time and space complexity. Kadane’s algorithm is one of the best-known methods for solving the maximum subarray problem efficiently in linear time.

#### **DP**
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int res = nums[0];

        int[] memo = new int[nums.length];
        memo[0] = nums[0];
        for(int i=1;i<nums.length;i++){
            memo[i] = nums[i] + Math.max(memo[i-1], 0);
            res = Math.max(res, memo[i]);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

The code you've provided is an alternative solution to the **Maximum Subarray Problem** using **dynamic programming**. This approach also solves the problem in linear time, but it uses an auxiliary array (`memo`) to store intermediate results. Let’s walk through the key parts of the solution and how it works.

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   ```java
   int res = nums[0];
   int[] memo = new int[nums.length];
   memo[0] = nums[0];
   ```
    - The variable `res` is initialized to the first element of `nums` (`nums[0]`). It keeps track of the maximum subarray sum found so far.
    - The `memo` array is used to store the maximum sum of subarrays that end at each index `i`. The first value `memo[0]` is initialized to `nums[0]` because the maximum subarray ending at the first element is simply the first element itself.

2. **Filling the `memo` Array:**
   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
       memo[i] = nums[i] + Math.max(memo[i - 1], 0);
       res = Math.max(res, memo[i]);
   }
   ```
    - The algorithm iterates through the array starting from index `1` to the end.
    - For each index `i`, the value `memo[i]` is computed as the current element (`nums[i]`) plus the maximum of the previous subarray sum (`memo[i-1]`) or `0`. This handles the case where the previous sum is negative, in which case it's better to start a new subarray from the current element.
    - After computing `memo[i]`, `res` is updated to be the maximum of the current `res` and `memo[i]`.

3. **Return the Result:**
   ```java
   return res;
   ```
   After iterating through the array, `res` will hold the maximum subarray sum, which is then returned.

### How This Dynamic Programming Approach Works:

- **Subproblem Definition:**
  `memo[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at index `i`. For each index, we decide whether to:
    - Continue the previous subarray (by adding `memo[i-1]` to `nums[i]`).
    - Start a new subarray from the current index (which means ignoring the previous sum if it is negative).

- **Recurrence Relation:**
  \[
  \text{memo}[i] = \text{nums}[i] + \max(\text{memo}[i-1], 0)
  \]
  This recurrence ensures that if the sum of the previous subarray is negative, we discard it and start fresh from the current index.

### Example:

Let’s walk through an example with `nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`:

1. **Initialization:**
    - `res = -2`
    - `memo = [-2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

2. **Filling the `memo` array:**
    - For `i = 1`: `memo[1] = 1 + max(-2, 0) = 1`, `res = max(-2, 1) = 1`
    - For `i = 2`: `memo[2] = -3 + max(1, 0) = -2`, `res = max(1, -2) = 1`
    - For `i = 3`: `memo[3] = 4 + max(-2, 0) = 4`, `res = max(1, 4) = 4`
    - For `i = 4`: `memo[4] = -1 + max(4, 0) = 3`, `res = max(4, 3) = 4`
    - For `i = 5`: `memo[5] = 2 + max(3, 0) = 5`, `res = max(4, 5) = 5`
    - For `i = 6`: `memo[6] = 1 + max(5, 0) = 6`, `res = max(5, 6) = 6`
    - For `i = 7`: `memo[7] = -5 + max(6, 0) = 1`, `res = max(6, 1) = 6`
    - For `i = 8`: `memo[8] = 4 + max(1, 0) = 5`, `res = max(6, 5) = 6`

The final `res` is `6`, which is the maximum subarray sum.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:**
  The time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm makes a single pass through the array.

- **Space Complexity:**
  The space complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the `memo` array, which stores the maximum sum for each subarray ending at each index.
#### **Optimized Approach**
### Optimized Approach (without `memo` array):
This solution can be optimized to \( O(1) \) space by using a variable to keep track of the previous subarray sum, eliminating the need for the `memo` array. The optimized approach would look like the following:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int res = nums[0];
        int sum = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum = nums[i] + Math.max(sum, 0);
            res = Math.max(res, sum);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

This optimized version has the same \( O(n) \) time complexity but uses \( O(1) \) space, as it only uses two variables (`res` and `sum`) instead of an auxiliary array.
