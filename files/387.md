# 387. First Unique Character in a String | M-184 | v

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        int[] counts = new int[26];
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) counts[c-'a']++;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++) {
            if(counts[s.charAt(i)-'a']==1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

This code is designed to find the index of the **first non-repeating character** in a string `s`. If there is no such character, it returns `-1`. Here's an explanation of how the code works:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Counting Frequency of Characters**:
    - The code uses an array `counts` of size 26 to store the frequency of each character. Since the problem only involves lowercase English letters (`'a'` to `'z'`), the size of the array is fixed at 26.
    - Each character is mapped to an index in the array using `c - 'a'`, where `c` is a character in the string `s`. This converts the character to an index between 0 and 25, corresponding to the position in the alphabet.

2. **First Pass (Counting Frequencies)**:
    - In the first loop, the code iterates through the string, converting each character to its corresponding index in the `counts` array and incrementing the value at that index to represent how many times the character appears in the string.

3. **Second Pass (Finding the First Unique Character)**:
    - In the second loop, the code checks each character's frequency by looking it up in the `counts` array. The first character whose frequency is 1 (i.e., it appears exactly once in the string) is returned as the result.

4. **Returning -1**:
    - If no character with a frequency of 1 is found by the end of the string, the function returns `-1`, indicating that there is no non-repeating character.

### Code Breakdown:

```java
class Solution {
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        // Create an array to count occurrences of each character (26 lowercase letters)
        int[] counts = new int[26];

        // First pass: count the frequency of each character in the string
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            counts[c - 'a']++;
        }

        // Second pass: find the first character with a count of 1
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (counts[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] == 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        // If no unique character is found, return -1
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Key Points:

1. **Array for Counting Frequencies**:
    - `int[] counts = new int[26];` creates an array to store the count of each lowercase letter.
    - The expression `c - 'a'` is used to get the position of a character in the alphabet, where `'a'` is at index 0, `'b'` is at index 1, and so on.

2. **First Loop**:
    - The code loops through the string `s` and increments the corresponding position in the `counts` array based on the character in the string. For example, if the string contains `'a'`, the count at index 0 (`counts[0]`) is incremented.

3. **Second Loop**:
    - The second loop iterates over the string `s` again, this time checking the frequency of each character by looking it up in the `counts` array. The first character with a count of `1` is considered the first non-repeating character, and its index is returned.

4. **Return Value**:
    - If no such character is found by the end of the string, the method returns `-1`.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input string `s = "leetcode"`:

1. **First Pass (Frequency Count)**:
    - `counts = [1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]` (after processing the entire string).
    - `'l'` appears once, `'e'` appears twice, `'t'`, `'c'`, `'o'`, and `'d'` each appear once.

2. **Second Pass (Find First Unique Character)**:
    - At index 0, `'l'` has a count of 1, so the result is `0` (the index of `'l'`).

Thus, the first non-repeating character is `'l'`, and the method returns `0`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The time complexity is linear, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We make two passes over the string:
    - One to count the frequency of characters (O(n)).
    - Another to find the first non-repeating character (O(n)).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because the size of the `counts` array is always 26, regardless of the size of the input string. We are using a fixed amount of space for the array to store character counts.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty String**: If `s` is an empty string, the code will skip both loops and return `-1`.
2. **All Repeating Characters**: If every character in the string appears more than once, the code will return `-1`.
3. **Single Character**: If the string consists of a single character, the method will return `0` since that character is non-repeating by default.
