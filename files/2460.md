# 2460. Apply Operations to an Array


数组元素in-place交换，利用指针记录被交换的元素位置。

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] applyOperations(int[] nums) {
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length-1;i++) {
            if(nums[i] == nums[i+1]) {
                nums[i] *= 2;
                nums[i+1] = 0;
            }
        }
        //System.out.println(Arrays.toString(nums));

        //1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1
        //   f
        //      i
        //1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1
        //      
        int f = -1;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++) {
            if(f==-1) {//never found 0
                if(nums[i]==0) {
                    f = i;
                }
            } else {//found 0 at lest once
                if(nums[i]!=0) {
                    nums[f] = nums[i];
                    nums[i] = 0;
                    f++;
                }
            }
            //System.out.println(i+", "+f+": "+ Arrays.toString(nums));
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
```

Your implementation of the `applyOperations` method is designed to perform two main tasks on an array of integers (`nums`):

1. **Merge Adjacent Equal Elements**: If two adjacent elements are equal, you double the first element and set the second to zero.
2. **Shift Non-zero Elements**: After merging, you shift all non-zero elements to the front of the array, effectively removing the zeros.

Let's break down your code to see how it works and evaluate its efficiency and correctness.

### Code Breakdown

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] applyOperations(int[] nums) {
        // Step 1: Merge adjacent equal elements
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if(nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                nums[i] *= 2; // Double the first element
                nums[i + 1] = 0; // Set the second element to zero
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Shift non-zero elements to the front
        int f = -1; // Pointer to track the position of the first zero found
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(f == -1) { // If zero has not been found yet
                if(nums[i] == 0) {
                    f = i; // Mark the position of the first zero
                }
            } else { // Zero has been found at least once
                if(nums[i] != 0) {
                    nums[f] = nums[i]; // Move non-zero element to the position of the first zero
                    nums[i] = 0; // Set current position to zero
                    f++; // Move the pointer to the next zero position
                }
            }
        }
        return nums; // Return the modified array
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Merging Adjacent Elements**:
    - You loop through the array and check if the current element is equal to the next one. If they are equal, the current element is doubled, and the next element is set to zero. This is done in a single pass.

2. **Shifting Non-Zero Elements**:
    - After merging, you have to compact the array by shifting non-zero elements forward.
    - You use a pointer `f` to track where the next non-zero element should go.
    - If you encounter a zero, you remember its position. If you find a non-zero element afterward, you move it to the position marked by `f` and continue.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Both the merging and shifting steps are \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the `nums` array. Therefore, the overall time complexity is \( O(n) \).

- **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is \( O(1) \) because the operations are performed in-place and no additional space proportional to the input size is used.

### Suggestions for Improvement

While your code is correct and efficient, here are some suggestions for enhancing clarity and maintainability:

1. **Clearer Variable Names**: Instead of using `f` as the pointer for the first zero, consider naming it `zeroIndex` or `nextZeroPos` for better readability.

2. **Additional Comments**: While your code is quite self-explanatory, adding comments to explain the purpose of each main block (merging and shifting) could be beneficial for future maintainability.

3. **Combine Steps**: You could combine the merging and shifting into a single loop to improve efficiency slightly, but your current implementation is already optimal for most practical purposes.

### Alternative Implementation

Here's a slightly revised version of your implementation that includes clearer variable names and combines the merging and shifting steps:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] applyOperations(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int index = 0; // Pointer for result array

        // Step 1: Merge adjacent equal elements and prepare for shifting
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i < n - 1 && nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                result[index++] = nums[i] * 2; // Double the value
                i++; // Skip the next element
            } else if (nums[i] != 0) {
                result[index++] = nums[i]; // Keep non-zero elements
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Fill remaining positions with zero
        while (index < n) {
            result[index++] = 0; // Set remaining positions to zero
        }

        return result; // Return the modified array
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Alternative Implementation

- This version creates a new result array to store the merged and shifted elements.
- It combines the merging and shifting logic into a single pass through the input array.
- After processing, it fills the remainder of the result array with zeros, simplifying the logic.

### Conclusion

Your original implementation is effective and correctly fulfills the problem requirements. The provided suggestions aim to enhance code clarity and maintainability.
