Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

利用第一个作为基准，不行就从后面减

```java
class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        if (strs.length == 0) return "";
        if (strs.length == 1) return strs[0];

        //use the first str as the benchmark
        String res = strs[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {//char index            
            while (!strs[i].startsWith(res)) {
                res = res.substring(0, res.length() - 1); //reduce the prefix
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The solution implements the algorithm to find the **longest common prefix** among an array of strings. The approach is simple and effective, comparing each string in the array to the prefix determined so far and reducing the prefix step by step until it matches across all strings.

### Approach

1. **Base Cases**:
    - If the input array `strs` is empty, return an empty string `""`.
    - If the array contains only one string, return that string itself since it's the common prefix.

2. **Initialize the Prefix**:
    - The first string in the array is considered as the initial "prefix" (`res`). This string will be progressively shortened as necessary to match the longest common prefix with other strings.

3. **Iterate Over the Strings**:
    - Starting from the second string (i.e., `i = 1`), the algorithm compares each string with the current prefix.
    - If the current string does not start with the prefix, the algorithm keeps shortening the prefix (removing the last character one by one) until the string starts with the prefix.
    - The prefix will be reduced to the longest common prefix between all strings processed so far.

4. **Return the Final Prefix**:
    - After processing all strings, the remaining value of `res` will be the longest common prefix.

### Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        // Base case: if no strings are provided
        if (strs.length == 0) return "";
        
        // If there's only one string, it is the common prefix
        if (strs.length == 1) return strs[0];

        // Use the first string as the initial prefix
        String res = strs[0];

        // Compare the prefix with each subsequent string
        for (int i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {
            // Keep reducing the prefix until the current string starts with it
            while (!strs[i].startsWith(res)) {
                res = res.substring(0, res.length() - 1); // Reduce prefix by one character
            }
        }

        // Return the longest common prefix
        return res;
    }
}
```

### Key Concepts

1. **Prefix Reduction**:
    - The algorithm reduces the `res` string gradually if it is not a prefix of the current string (`strs[i]`).
    - The `startsWith()` method is used to check whether the string starts with the current prefix.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
    - An empty array returns an empty prefix immediately.
    - A single string array returns that string as the prefix.
    - If no common prefix exists among all the strings, the result will be an empty string (since the prefix is progressively reduced).

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:

**Input**: `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`

- Start with the first string as the prefix: `res = "flower"`.
- Compare `res` with `"flow"`:
    - `"flower"` doesn't start with `"flow"`, so reduce `res` to `"flow"`.
- Compare `res` with `"flight"`:
    - `"flow"` doesn't start with `"flight"`, so reduce `res` to `"flo"`.
    - `"flo"` doesn't start with `"flight"`, so reduce `res` to `"fl"`.
    - `"fl"` starts with `"flight"`.
- The longest common prefix is `"fl"`.

**Output**: `"fl"`

#### Example 2:

**Input**: `["dog", "racecar", "car"]`

- Start with the first string as the prefix: `res = "dog"`.
- Compare `res` with `"racecar"`:
    - `"dog"` doesn't start with `"racecar"`, so reduce `res` to `"do"`, then to `"d"`, and finally to an empty string.
- The longest common prefix is `""`.

**Output**: `""`

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \times M)\), where \(N\) is the number of strings in the array, and \(M\) is the length of the shortest string. In the worst case, each string comparison may involve comparing up to \(M\) characters.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as only a few variables are used (no extra space proportional to input size is required).

This solution efficiently finds the longest common prefix by iteratively reducing the prefix until it matches for all strings.
