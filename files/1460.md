# 1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Sub-arrays | M-150

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canBeEqual(int[] target, int[] arr) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int a : arr) map.put(a, map.getOrDefault(a, 0)+1);
        for(int a : target) map.put(a, map.getOrDefault(a, 0)-1);
        for(int a : map.keySet()) if(map.get(a)!=0) return false;
        return true;
    }
}
```

This code provides a solution to check if two integer arrays, `target` and `arr`, can be made equal by reversing any number of subarrays in `arr`. Essentially, this problem boils down to checking whether `target` is a permutation of `arr`, since reversing subarrays does not change the elements but only rearranges them.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Checking Element Frequencies**:
    - The algorithm counts the occurrences (frequencies) of each integer in both arrays. If both arrays have the same numbers with the same frequencies, they can be made equal by reversing subarrays, since permutations only differ in order.

2. **HashMap Usage**:
    - A `HashMap<Integer, Integer>` is used to store the frequency of elements in `arr` and then adjust the frequency counts based on the elements in `target`.
    - If the final frequency count of any element is not zero after processing both arrays, it means `arr` cannot be rearranged to match `target`.

### Code Breakdown:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canBeEqual(int[] target, int[] arr) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Step 1: Count frequencies of elements in `arr`
        for (int a : arr) {
            map.put(a, map.getOrDefault(a, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Step 2: Decrease frequencies based on elements in `target`
        for (int a : target) {
            map.put(a, map.getOrDefault(a, 0) - 1);
        }

        // Step 3: Check if all counts are zero
        for (int a : map.keySet()) {
            if (map.get(a) != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Key Points:

1. **Step 1: Counting Frequencies in `arr`**:
    - The code iterates over `arr` and populates the `map` with the frequency of each element. If an element is already present, its count is incremented; otherwise, it is added with an initial count of `1`.

2. **Step 2: Adjusting Frequencies for `target`**:
    - For each element in `target`, the code decreases its count in the `map`. If an element is not present in the `map` (i.e., it's not in `arr`), the default count is zero, and the frequency is decremented, resulting in negative values.

3. **Step 3: Validating Frequency Counts**:
    - After processing both `arr` and `target`, the code checks if all counts in the `map` are zero. If any count is not zero, it means that the arrays do not have the same elements with the same frequencies, and the function returns `false`. If all counts are zero, the function returns `true`.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input:

```java
int[] target = {1, 2, 3, 4};
int[] arr = {2, 4, 1, 3};
```

1. **Step 1: Counting Frequencies in `arr`**:
    - After processing `arr = {2, 4, 1, 3}`, the `map` will be:
        - `map = {2: 1, 4: 1, 1: 1, 3: 1}`

2. **Step 2: Adjusting Frequencies for `target`**:
    - After processing `target = {1, 2, 3, 4}`, the `map` will be:
        - `map = {2: 0, 4: 0, 1: 0, 3: 0}`

3. **Step 3: Validating Frequency Counts**:
    - All values in the `map` are zero, meaning `arr` can be rearranged to match `target`. The function returns `true`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The time complexity is linear in terms of the size of the input arrays, where `n` is the length of `arr` or `target`. We iterate over both arrays once, and the operations on the `HashMap` (put and get) take constant time on average.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The space complexity is proportional to the number of unique elements in `arr`, as the `HashMap` stores the frequencies of the elements. In the worst case, if all elements are unique, the `HashMap` will store `n` entries, where `n` is the length of `arr`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Different Lengths**: If `target` and `arr` are of different lengths, the problem guarantees that this won't happen based on problem constraints. However, if that condition is violated, an initial length check can be added to return `false`.

2. **Arrays with Repeating Elements**: The approach handles arrays with repeating elements correctly, as the `HashMap` tracks the frequency of each element. For example, if `target = [1, 1, 2, 2]` and `arr = [2, 2, 1, 1]`, the code will return `true` because the frequencies match.

3. **Empty Arrays**: If both `target` and `arr` are empty (`target = []`, `arr = []`), the result should be `true`, since two empty arrays can be considered equal.

### Optimizations:
Although the solution is efficient in terms of time complexity, an alternative approach would be to sort both arrays and compare them directly. However, sorting takes `O(n log n)` time, making the current `O(n)` solution using a `HashMap` more optimal.
