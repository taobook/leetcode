# 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters | M-304

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int countCharacters(String[] words, String chars) {
        int[] counts = new int[26];
        for(char c : chars.toCharArray()) counts[c-'a']++;
        int res = 0;
        for(String word : words){
            boolean good = true;
            int[] cc = counts.clone();
            char[] ch = word.toCharArray();
            //remove
            for(char c : ch){
                cc[c-'a']--;
                if(cc[c-'a']<0) {
                    good = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if(good) res+= ch.length;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

This code provides a solution to the problem of determining the total length of all words from an array `words` that can be formed using the characters from a string `chars`. Each character in `chars` can only be used once per word, so the words in the array need to be checked against the available character counts in `chars`.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Counting Characters in `chars`**:
    - An integer array `counts` of size 26 is used to store the frequency of each character in the string `chars`. Each index corresponds to a letter in the alphabet, where index `0` is `'a'`, index `1` is `'b'`, and so on.

2. **Checking Each Word**:
    - For each word in the array `words`, the program checks whether the word can be formed using the characters in `chars` without exceeding the available counts of any character. A temporary array `cc` (a clone of `counts`) is created for each word, and characters are subtracted from this array as they are used.
    - If any character count becomes negative, it means the word cannot be formed, and the word is skipped. Otherwise, if the word can be formed, its length is added to the result.

### Code Breakdown:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countCharacters(String[] words, String chars) {
        // Array to count occurrences of each character in the string `chars`
        int[] counts = new int[26];
        for (char c : chars.toCharArray()) {
            counts[c - 'a']++;
        }

        int res = 0;  // Variable to store the total length of valid words

        // Iterate over each word in the array `words`
        for (String word : words) {
            boolean good = true;  // Flag to check if the word can be formed
            int[] cc = counts.clone();  // Clone the `counts` array to use for this word
            char[] ch = word.toCharArray();  // Convert the word to a char array

            // Try to use the characters in the word
            for (char c : ch) {
                cc[c - 'a']--;  // Decrease the count for this character
                if (cc[c - 'a'] < 0) {  // If any character count becomes negative, the word cannot be formed
                    good = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            // If the word is valid, add its length to the result
            if (good) {
                res += ch.length;
            }
        }

        return res;  // Return the total length of all valid words
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Key Points:

1. **Character Counting for `chars`**:
    - The array `counts` is used to store how many times each character appears in `chars`. For example, if `chars = "atach"`, the `counts` array would look like:
        - `counts = [2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, where `2` corresponds to `'a'`, `1` corresponds to `'t'`, and so on.

2. **Cloning `counts` for Each Word**:
    - For each word in `words`, a clone of the `counts` array is created (`cc = counts.clone()`). This clone allows the code to modify the character counts for the current word without affecting the original `counts` array.

3. **Checking Each Word**:
    - As each character of the word is processed, the code decreases the count in `cc` for that character (`cc[c - 'a']--`). If any count becomes negative (i.e., the word requires more of a character than is available in `chars`), the word is marked as invalid (`good = false`).
    - If the word is valid (i.e., all required characters were available in sufficient quantity), its length is added to `res`.

4. **Final Result**:
    - After processing all the words, the value of `res` (the total length of valid words) is returned.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input:

```java
String[] words = {"cat", "bt", "hat", "tree"};
String chars = "atach";
```

1. The `counts` array for `chars = "atach"` will be:
    - `counts = [2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ...]` (i.e., `'a'` appears 2 times, `'t'` appears once, `'c'` appears once, and `'h'` appears once).

2. Processing each word:
    - For the word `"cat"`:
        - It uses `1` `'c'`, `1` `'a'`, and `1` `'t'`. All these characters are available in `counts`, so `"cat"` can be formed, and `res += 3` (the length of `"cat"`).
    - For the word `"bt"`:
        - The character `'b'` is not available in `counts`, so `"bt"` cannot be formed, and `res` remains unchanged.
    - For the word `"hat"`:
        - It uses `1` `'h'`, `1` `'a'`, and `1` `'t'`. All these characters are available in `counts`, so `"hat"` can be formed, and `res += 3` (the length of `"hat"`).
    - For the word `"tree"`:
        - The character `'r'` is not available in `counts`, so `"tree"` cannot be formed, and `res` remains unchanged.

Final result: `res = 3 (for "cat") + 3 (for "hat") = 6`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n \* m)**: Where `n` is the number of words in the `words` array, and `m` is the average length of the words. For each word, we clone the `counts` array and iterate through the characters in the word, leading to O(m) work per word.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(26) = O(1)**: The space used for the `counts` array is constant (26 elements, one for each letter of the alphabet). The `cc` array is cloned for each word, but its size is always fixed at 26, so space complexity is still constant.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty `words` or `chars`**: If either the `words` array or the `chars` string is empty, the result will be `0` since no words can be formed.
2. **Words Longer Than `chars`**: If a word requires more of a character than available in `chars`, it will not contribute to the result.
3. **All Words Can Be Formed**: If every word can be formed, the result will be the sum of the lengths of all words.

This approach is efficient and leverages the fixed size of the alphabet to keep operations simple and fast.
