# 1608. Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X


排序

为了满足“正好有x个元素大于等于x”

从大往小数，数的过程中，用当前数字和已数的长度比
- 如果“当前数字”大于等于“已经数过的长度x”，那说明比当前数字更大的数字都大于等于x，那就相当于“至少有x个元素大于等于x”
  - 再判断当前数字更前面的数字是否<x，如果是，则完全满足“正好有x个元素大于等于x”，那x即为答案
  - 如果所有数据都大于长度x，那么答案就是长度本身x

```java
class Solution {
    public int specialArray(int[] nums) {
        int res = -1;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        // [0, 0, 3, 4, 4]正好3个元素>=3
        // [0, 0, 3, 3, 4, 4] 多于3个元素>=3，不符合要求
        //System.out.println(Arrays.toString(nums));
        for(int i=nums.length-1;i>=0;i--){
            int x = nums.length-i;//totally x elements, including current one
            if(nums[i] >= x) {//the smallest one >=x, i.e. there are "at least" x numbers >= x
                //[3, 5]=>2 [3] => 1
                if(i==0 || i>0 && nums[i-1]<x) {//exactly x numbers >= x
                    return x;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

Your implementation of the `specialArray` function is designed to determine the "special" value \( x \) based on the criteria that exactly \( x \) elements in the given array `nums` must be greater than or equal to \( x \). Let's break down your code and see how it works, along with suggestions for improvements.

### Code Breakdown

```java
class Solution {
    public int specialArray(int[] nums) {
        int res = -1;
        Arrays.sort(nums); // Sort the array first

        // Loop from the largest element down to the smallest
        for(int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int x = nums.length - i; // Calculate how many numbers are >= nums[i]

            // Check if the current number is >= x
            if (nums[i] >= x) {
                // Ensure there are exactly x numbers >= x
                if (i == 0 || (i > 0 && nums[i - 1] < x)) {
                    return x; // Found a valid x
                }
            }
        }
        return -1; // No valid x found
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting the Array**:
  - The array is sorted to make it easier to count how many elements are greater than or equal to any given value.

2. **Iterating Backwards**:
  - The loop starts from the end of the sorted array (the largest value) and moves backwards. This helps in determining how many elements are greater than or equal to `x` quickly.

3. **Calculating \( x \)**:
  - For each element at index `i`, `x` is calculated as `nums.length - i`, which effectively counts how many numbers from the current index to the end of the array are being considered.

4. **Condition Check**:
  - The check `if (nums[i] >= x)` ensures that the current number is at least \( x \).
  - The second condition, `if (i == 0 || (i > 0 && nums[i - 1] < x))`, checks whether this is the only number (or one of a few) that meets the criteria, ensuring that the count of numbers greater than or equal to \( x \) is exactly \( x \).

5. **Returning the Result**:
  - If a valid \( x \) is found, it is returned; otherwise, the function returns -1, indicating no valid \( x \) exists.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The sorting step has a complexity of \( O(n \log n) \), and the subsequent loop runs in \( O(n) \). Thus, the overall complexity is \( O(n \log n) \).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \( O(1) \) since we are only using a fixed amount of space, excluding the input.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Early Exit**:
  - You can add an early exit if the maximum number in `nums` is less than the number of elements in the array. If `max(nums) < nums.length`, it’s impossible to find a valid \( x \).

2. **Streamlined Logic**:
  - The logic can be simplified slightly for better readability by using meaningful variable names and reducing nested conditions.

### Alternative Implementation

Here’s a slightly optimized version of your function:

```java
class Solution {
    public int specialArray(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;

        for (int x = 0; x <= n; x++) { // Possible values of x can be 0 to n
            int count = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num >= x) count++;
            }
            if (count == x) return x; // Check if exactly x numbers are >= x
        }

        return -1; // No valid x found
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Alternative Approach

- The outer loop checks all possible values of \( x \) from 0 to \( n \).
- The inner loop counts how many numbers in `nums` are greater than or equal to \( x \).
- If exactly \( x \) numbers meet the criteria, it returns \( x \).
