# 2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets

## Problem Statement
You are given a **0-indexed**, **strictly increasing** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `diff`. A triplet `(i, j, k)` is an **arithmetic triplet** if the following conditions are met:

*   `i < j < k`,
*   `nums[j] - nums[i] == diff`, and
*   `nums[k] - nums[j] == diff`.

Return _the number of unique **arithmetic triplets**._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,4,6,7,10\], diff = 3 

**Output:** 2 

**Explanation:** (1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3. (2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,8,9\], diff = 2 

**Output:** 2 

**Explanation:** (0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2. (1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.

**Constraints:**

*   `3 <= nums.length <= 200`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 200`
*   `1 <= diff <= 50`
*   `nums` is **strictly** increasing.

## Solution
利用two sum思想，往回看：用当前数字n 减去diff，找到倒数第一数n_1，再用n_1减去diff，找到倒数第二数n_2
```java
class Solution {
    public int arithmeticTriplets(int[] nums, int diff) {
        int res = 0;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int n : nums) {
            int n_1 = n - diff; // Second element of the triplet
            int n_2 = n_1 - diff; // First element of the triplet
            if(set.contains(n_1) && set.contains(n_2)) {
                res++; // Found a valid triplet
            }
            set.add(n); // Add current number to the set
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

The provided solution aims to count the number of arithmetic triplets in the given array `nums`, where a triplet consists of three elements `x`, `y`, and `z` such that `y - x = diff` and `z - y = diff`, or equivalently, `z - x = 2 * diff`.

### Key Concepts:
- **Arithmetic Triplets**: These are triplets `(nums[i], nums[j], nums[k])` where `i < j < k` and the differences between the consecutive elements are equal to `diff`.
- The task is to efficiently find all such triplets in the array `nums`.

### Approach:
1. **Use a HashSet for Lookup**: The solution leverages a **set** (`set`) to store all numbers encountered so far in the iteration through the array `nums`. For each number `n` in the array:
    - It checks whether both `n - diff` (i.e., `n_1`) and `n_1 - diff` (i.e., `n_2`) exist in the set. If both are found, then `n_2`, `n_1`, and `n` form an arithmetic triplet.
    - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the result counter `res`.
    - Finally, the current number `n` is added to the set for future lookups.

### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm iterates through the array `nums` once, which takes `O(n)` time.
- Each lookup and insertion operation in the set takes `O(1)` time on average, resulting in an overall time complexity of **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the storage required for the set, which at most holds `n` elements, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.


### Example:
For `nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10]` and `diff = 3`:
- The valid triplets are `(1, 4, 7)` and `(4, 7, 10)`.
- The result will be `2`.

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Initialize result**: `int res = 0;` initializes the result counter.
2. **Initialize set**: `Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();` initializes the set to keep track of numbers seen so far.
3. **For loop**: Iterates over each number `n` in `nums`.
4. **Check conditions**: For each `n`, it checks if both `n - diff` and `n - 2 * diff` exist in the set. If they do, it means we have found a valid arithmetic triplet.
5. **Update set**: The number `n` is added to the set for future checks.
6. **Return result**: Finally, `res` is returned, which contains the count of valid triplets.

This solution is efficient and concise, solving the problem in linear time with constant-time lookups using a HashSet.
