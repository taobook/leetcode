# 419. Battleships in a Board | M-205
```java
class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X' &&
                        (i == 0 || board[i - 1][j] == '.') &&
                        (j == 0 || board[i][j - 1] == '.')) {
                    result++;
                }

            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
This `countBattleships` solution effectively counts the number of battleships present in a given 2D board. The board is represented as a grid of characters, where:

- `'X'` represents part of a battleship.
- `'.'` represents water.

### Problem Understanding:

In the problem, battleships are represented as continuous sequences of `'X'` characters, which can be placed either horizontally or vertically. The task is to count the number of distinct battleships on the board.

### Solution Logic:

The key insight is that we should count only the top-left corner of a battleship. A battleship is counted if:
1. The current cell contains `'X'`.
2. The cell directly above it is either out of bounds or contains `'.'` (no continuation of a battleship vertically).
3. The cell directly to the left is either out of bounds or contains `'.'` (no continuation of a battleship horizontally).

This ensures that only the first `'X'` in each battleship (either horizontally or vertically) is counted, and we don't count the same battleship multiple times.

### Code Breakdown:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        int result = 0;
        
        // Iterate over the entire board
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                
                // If the current cell is part of a battleship ('X')
                if (board[i][j] == 'X' &&
                    (i == 0 || board[i - 1][j] == '.') && // No continuation upwards
                    (j == 0 || board[i][j - 1] == '.')) { // No continuation to the left
                    
                    result++; // Found a new battleship, increment count
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Conditions for counting a battleship**:
    - **`board[i][j] == 'X'`**: This checks if the current cell is part of a battleship.
    - **`i == 0 || board[i - 1][j] == '.'`**: This ensures there is no battleship directly above, i.e., either it's the first row or the cell above it is water (`'.'`).
    - **`j == 0 || board[i][j - 1] == '.'`**: This ensures there is no battleship to the left, i.e., either it's the first column or the cell to the left is water (`'.'`).

This guarantees that only the first cell of each battleship (either horizontally or vertically) is counted, preventing double-counting.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. The solution iterates through every cell exactly once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, since the solution uses only a few extra variables and processes the board in-place without additional data structures.

### Example:

#### Input:
```plaintext
[
 ['X', '.', '.', 'X'],
 ['.', '.', '.', 'X'],
 ['.', '.', '.', 'X']
]
```

#### Output:
```plaintext
2
```

- The first battleship occupies `board[0][0]`.
- The second battleship occupies the column starting from `board[0][3]` to `board[2][3]`.

### Conclusion:

This solution efficiently counts the number of battleships by focusing on the first cell of each distinct battleship and avoids counting any battleship parts that are continuations of previously counted ships.
