### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> summaryRanges(int[] nums) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if(nums.length==0) return res;

        int start = nums[0];//第一个
        for(int i=1;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]!=nums[i-1]+1){//和前一个比，若不连续
                res.add(range(start, nums[i-1]));//断开，并收拾start~nums[i-1]
                start = nums[i];//重新开始
            }
        }
        res.add(range(start, nums[nums.length-1]));//收拾最后一个
        return res;
    }

    private String range(int start, int end){
        return start==end?String.valueOf(start):start+"->"+end;
    }
}
```
This Java class, `Solution`, implements a method `summaryRanges` which takes an integer array `nums` and returns a list of string representations of the ranges in the array.

### Explanation of the code:
1. **Initialization:**
    - The method `summaryRanges` creates an empty `ArrayList<String>` named `res` to store the result.
    - It checks if the array `nums` is empty; if so, it returns the empty list `res`.

2. **Iterating over the array:**
    - The method initializes a `start` variable with the value of the first element of `nums`.
    - It then iterates through the array starting from the second element (`i = 1`).
    - During each iteration, the code checks if the current element is not the consecutive number of the previous element (`nums[i] != nums[i - 1] + 1`). If this is the case, it means the sequence has ended:
        - A range string is added to the result list using the helper method `range`, which takes `start` and `nums[i - 1]` as arguments.
        - The `start` variable is updated to the current number to mark the beginning of a new range.

3. **Handling the last range:**
    - After the loop ends, there may still be a remaining range to add to the result list, which is done using the `start` and the last element of the array (`nums[nums.length - 1]`).

4. **Helper Method `range`:**
    - This method takes two arguments, `start` and `end`, and returns a string representation of the range:
        - If `start` is equal to `end`, it returns the string version of `start` (i.e., a single number).
        - Otherwise, it returns the range in the form `"start->end"`.

### Example:
For an input array `nums = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7]`, this is how the method works:

1. Start with `start = 0`.
2. When `i = 3`, `nums[3]` is `4`, which is not consecutive from `2` (`nums[2] + 1`). Thus, the range `"0->2"` is added to the result list, and `start` is updated to `4`.
3. At `i = 5`, `nums[5]` is `7`, which is not consecutive from `5` (`nums[4] + 1`). The range `"4->5"` is added to the result list, and `start` is updated to `7`.
4. The loop ends, and the final range `"7"` is added to the result list.

The final output would be:
```java
["0->2", "4->5", "7"]
```
