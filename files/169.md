# 169. Majority Element | M-357 | v

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int count= 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(int num:nums){
            if(count==0) res = num;//拿出来投票，超过半数者赢
            count += num==res?1:-1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

This Java class `Solution` implements a method `majorityElement`, which is designed to find the **majority element** in an integer array `nums`. The majority element is defined as the element that appears more than half of the times in the array. The solution uses **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**, which is a very efficient way to solve this problem with linear time complexity and constant space.

### Key Concept:
The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm works on the principle of canceling out different elements. The idea is that if an element occurs more than half of the time in an array, it will survive after the "voting" process, even when canceling out elements that are different.

### Explanation of the code:
1. **Initialization:**
    - `count` is initialized to `0`. It will track the "votes" for the potential majority element.
    - `res` is initialized to `0`. It will store the potential majority element.

2. **Iterating through the array:**
    - The method iterates over each number `num` in the array.
    - If `count` is `0`, this means we don't currently have a candidate for the majority element, so we pick the current number `num` as the new candidate by assigning it to `res`.
    - We then either increase or decrease the count:
        - If `num` is the same as `res`, the count is incremented by 1.
        - If `num` is different from `res`, the count is decremented by 1.

   The algorithm ensures that the majority element will eventually remain as the candidate after iterating through the entire array, even after all the cancellations.

3. **Returning the result:**
    - Once the iteration completes, the method returns the value stored in `res`, which will be the majority element.

### Example:

Consider the input array `nums = [3, 2, 3]`:

- Initially, `count = 0`, `res = 0`.
- First iteration:
    - `num = 3`, `count == 0`, so `res = 3`, and `count = 1` (we start "voting" for `3`).
- Second iteration:
    - `num = 2`, `count != 0`, `num != res`, so `count = 0` (vote is canceled out).
- Third iteration:
    - `num = 3`, `count == 0`, so `res = 3` again, and `count = 1`.

After all iterations, the majority element `3` remains as the value in `res`.

Thus, the output will be:
```java
3
```

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. The algorithm only requires one pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because it only uses a few extra variables, regardless of the input size.
