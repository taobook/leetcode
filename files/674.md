# 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence | M-214

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        int left = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]<=nums[i-1]){//和前一个比，不再增长了
                res = Math.max(res, i-left);
                left = i;//那就重新开始
            }
        }
        res = Math.max(res, nums.length-left);//最后一个
        return res;
    }
}
```

This solution is designed to find the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (LCIS) in an array of integers. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Sliding Window Approach**:
    - The variable `left` represents the starting index of a potential increasing subsequence.
    - The loop traverses the array and checks if each element is greater than the previous one to maintain the increasing subsequence.
    - If the subsequence breaks (i.e., `nums[i] <= nums[i-1]`), the current length of the increasing subsequence is compared with the previous maximum (`res`), and the `left` pointer is reset to the current index to start a new subsequence.

2. **Final Adjustment**:
    - After the loop ends, there could be a case where the longest subsequence goes till the end of the array. So, after the loop, the code compares the length of the sequence from the `left` pointer to the end of the array.

### Code Breakdown:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        // Edge case: if the array is empty, return 0
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int res = 0;  // To store the maximum length of LCIS
        int left = 0; // Left pointer to mark the start of an increasing subsequence
        
        // Traverse the array starting from the second element
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // If the current element is not greater than the previous, the subsequence breaks
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
                // Update the result with the maximum length found so far
                res = Math.max(res, i - left);
                // Reset the left pointer to the current element's index
                left = i;
            }
        }
        
        // Check the length of the subsequence from the last reset of left to the end of the array
        res = Math.max(res, nums.length - left);
        
        return res; // Return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Edge Case**:
    - If the array is empty (`nums.length == 0`), the result should be 0 because there is no subsequence.

2. **Main Logic**:
    - The variable `res` holds the maximum length of any increasing subsequence encountered so far.
    - The loop starts from index 1 and compares the current element (`nums[i]`) with the previous one (`nums[i - 1]`):
        - If the current element is greater than the previous, the subsequence continues.
        - If it's less than or equal to the previous element, the increasing sequence ends, and the length of that subsequence (`i - left`) is compared with `res` to update the result.
        - The `left` pointer is then reset to the current index (`i`) to start a new subsequence.

3. **Final Comparison**:
    - After the loop finishes, it's possible that the longest subsequence extends to the end of the array, so we compare the length from the `left` pointer to the end (`nums.length - left`) with `res` one last time to ensure we don't miss it.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The algorithm only traverses the array once, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space used by the algorithm is constant, as only a few integer variables (`res`, `left`) are used.

### Example:

For the input array `nums = [1, 3, 5, 4, 7]`:

1. Start with `left = 0`, `res = 0`.
2. For `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 3` (greater than `nums[0] = 1`), continue.
3. For `i = 2`, `nums[2] = 5` (greater than `nums[1] = 3`), continue.
4. For `i = 3`, `nums[3] = 4` (less than `nums[2] = 5`), update `res = Math.max(0, 3 - 0) = 3`. Set `left = 3`.
5. For `i = 4`, `nums[4] = 7` (greater than `nums[3] = 4`), continue.
6. After the loop, update `res = Math.max(3, 5 - 3) = 3`.

So the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence is `3` (i.e., the subsequence `[1, 3, 5]`).
