This `candyCrush` solution simulates the process of marking and crushing candies in a grid, similar to how the game Candy Crush works. It follows two main steps: marking candies that need to be crushed, and then compressing the board by moving remaining candies down.

### Solution Breakdown:

1. **Marking Candies to Be Crushed**:
    - **Horizontal Check**: For every row, it scans from left to right to check if three consecutive candies are the same. If they are, they are marked for crushing by converting them to negative values. This is done using `Math.abs()` to handle already marked values.
    - **Vertical Check**: Similarly, for every column, it scans from top to bottom to mark three consecutive candies with the same value as negative values.

2. **Compressing the Board**:
    - After marking the candies, the next step is to "crush" them. In Candy Crush, this means removing the matched candies and letting the remaining candies fall to fill the empty spaces.
    - **Column by Column Compression**: Each column is processed from bottom to top. If a cell contains a positive value (i.e., not marked for crushing), it is moved to the lowest available position in that column. Then, the remaining cells above it are filled with zeroes.

3. **Recursive Call**:
    - If any candies were crushed (detected by checking if any cells were changed to zero), the process is repeated to check for any new matches after the candies have fallen.

4. **Termination**:
    - The recursion stops when no new matches are found, meaning the board has reached a stable state.

### Code Walkthrough:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] candyCrush(int[][] board) {
        int rows = board.length;
        int cols = board[0].length;
        
        // Step 1: Mark candies for crushing (both horizontally and vertically)
        // Horizontal check
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 2; j < cols; j++) { // Start checking from the third element in each row
                if (Math.abs(board[i][j - 2]) == Math.abs(board[i][j - 1])
                        && Math.abs(board[i][j - 1]) == Math.abs(board[i][j])) {
                    board[i][j - 2] = -Math.abs(board[i][j - 2]); // Mark as negative
                    board[i][j - 1] = -Math.abs(board[i][j - 1]);
                    board[i][j] = -Math.abs(board[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Vertical check
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            for (int i = 2; i < rows; i++) { // Start checking from the third element in each column
                if (Math.abs(board[i - 2][j]) == Math.abs(board[i - 1][j])
                        && Math.abs(board[i - 1][j]) == Math.abs(board[i][j])) {
                    board[i - 2][j] = -Math.abs(board[i - 2][j]); // Mark as negative
                    board[i - 1][j] = -Math.abs(board[i - 1][j]);
                    board[i][j] = -Math.abs(board[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Crush and compress the board (move positive values down)
        boolean changed = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            int bottom = rows - 1; // Start from the bottom of the column
            for (int i = rows - 1; i >= 0; i--) { // Move non-negative values to the bottom
                if (board[i][j] > 0) {
                    board[bottom][j] = board[i][j];
                    bottom--;
                }
            }
            // Fill remaining positions with zero (representing the crushed candies)
            while (bottom >= 0) {
                if (board[bottom][j] != 0) {
                    board[bottom][j] = 0;
                    changed = true; // Track if any changes were made
                }
                bottom--;
            }
        }

        // Recursive call: If the board changed, recursively apply candyCrush
        if (changed) {
            candyCrush(board);
        }

        return board;
    }
}
```

### Key Features:

1. **Marking with Negatives**:
    - When candies are marked for crushing, they are changed to their negative value using `Math.abs()` to avoid conflicts with already marked candies during vertical and horizontal checks.

2. **Column Compression**:
    - The board is compressed in a manner similar to the "move zeros" pattern, where non-zero values (uncrushed candies) are moved down, and the rest of the column is filled with zeros.

3. **Recursion**:
    - The function recursively calls itself as long as changes are made to the board. This ensures that any new matches formed after candies fall are processed.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)** per recursive call, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. The marking and compression operations both process every cell in the matrix.
- However, since there could be multiple recursive calls, the worst-case time complexity is higher, but in practice, the number of calls is usually limited.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, because the marking and crushing are done in-place on the input `board`, without using any additional significant data structures.

### Example:

#### Input:
```plaintext
[
 [110, 5, 112, 113, 114],
 [210, 211, 5, 213, 214],
 [310, 311, 3, 313, 314],
 [410, 411, 412, 5, 414],
 [5, 1, 512, 3, 3],
 [610, 4, 1, 613, 614],
 [710, 1, 2, 713, 714],
 [810, 1, 2, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 2, 2, 2],
 [4, 1, 4, 4, 1014]
]
```

#### Process:
1. Mark all candies that form horizontal or vertical triplets.
2. Crush (remove) the marked candies by setting them to zero and allowing the remaining candies to fall down.
3. Repeat the process until no more candies can be crushed.

#### Output:
```plaintext
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [110, 0, 0, 0, 114],
 [210, 0, 0, 0, 214],
 [310, 0, 0, 113, 314],
 [410, 211, 112, 213, 414],
 [610, 311, 412, 313, 614],
 [710, 411, 512, 613, 714],
 [810, 5, 1, 713, 1014]
]
```

### Conclusion:
This solution simulates the core mechanics of the Candy Crush game by marking, crushing, and compressing the board repeatedly until a stable state is reached. It is efficient due to its in-place operations and recursive process that stops once no more matches can be made.
