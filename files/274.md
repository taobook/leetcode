# 274. H-Index | M-287

The provided code aims to calculate the **H-index** for a researcher given an array of citations. The H-index is a metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and impact of the published work of a researcher. Specifically, a researcher has an H-index of **h** if **h** of their papers have at least **h** citations each, and the rest of the papers have **≤ h** citations.

## **Sort**

Let's break down the code:

### Code Explanation:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int h = 0;
        Arrays.sort(citations); // Step 1: Sort the citations array in ascending order.
        for(int i = citations.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { // Step 2: Iterate the sorted array from the end (largest citation).
            if(citations[i] >= (citations.length - 1 - i) + 1) { // Step 3: Check if the current citation is at least (n-i)+1.
                h = (citations.length - 1 - i) + 1; // Step 4: Update the H-index based on the condition.
            }
        }
        return h; // Return the final calculated H-index.
    }
}
```

### Key Steps:

1. **Sorting the citations array:**  
   First, the citations array is sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps to iterate over the papers starting from the most cited to the least, allowing easier calculation of the H-index.

2. **Iterating from the highest citation:**  
   The `for` loop iterates from the last element (highest citation) to the first (lowest citation).

3. **Updating the H-index:**  
   For each paper, it checks if the citation count at that index is greater than or equal to `(n-i) + 1`, where `n` is the length of the citations array, and `i` is the current index. The formula `(n-i) + 1` essentially represents the number of papers (including the current one and those to its right) that must have at least that many citations.

4. **Returning the result:**  
   The final result is the maximum value of `h` where the condition holds true.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input array `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`:
- After sorting, `citations = [0, 1, 3, 5, 6]`.
- Iterate from the highest value:
    - For `citations[4] = 6`, check if `6 >= (5 - 4) + 1 = 2`. True, so `h = 2`.
    - For `citations[3] = 5`, check if `5 >= (5 - 3) + 1 = 3`. True, so `h = 3`.
    - For `citations[2] = 3`, check if `3 >= (5 - 2) + 1 = 4`. False, so `h` remains 3.

Thus, the H-index is `3`.

### Optimizations:
- The current solution sorts the citations array, which takes `O(n log n)` time, and then iterates through it in `O(n)` time. This makes the overall time complexity `O(n log n)`.
- A more efficient approach exists with `O(n)` time complexity by using a counting sort-based algorithm that avoids sorting the citations array. However, the current solution is clear and correct.

Would you like to discuss possible improvements or an alternative solution?


## **Optimized**
Great! Let's explore a more **optimized solution** for calculating the H-index that avoids sorting and runs in linear time (`O(n)`), using a **bucket sort approach**.

### Key Idea:
- Instead of sorting the array, we can leverage the fact that the H-index is bounded by the number of papers, `n` (the length of the citations array).
- We create an array (`buckets`) where each index represents a possible citation count. For instance:
    - `buckets[i]` will store the number of papers that have exactly `i` citations.
    - For citations larger than `n`, we group them together in a special bucket since having more than `n` citations won’t affect the result (we only care if at least `n` papers have `n` citations or more).

This approach can be achieved in `O(n)` time, as we avoid sorting and instead iterate over the citations array a fixed number of times.

### Optimized Solution (Bucket Sort Approach):

```java
public class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int[] buckets = new int[n + 1]; // Array to count citations.

        // Step 1: Populate the buckets array.
        for (int c : citations) {
            if (c >= n) {
                buckets[n]++; // Group all papers with n or more citations.
            } else {
                buckets[c]++;
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Traverse the buckets from the end (highest citations).
        int h = 0; // This will track how many papers have at least h citations.
        for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
            h += buckets[i]; // Count papers with i or more citations.
            if (h >= i) {
                return i; // Return the first index where h >= i, which is the H-index.
            }
        }
        
        return 0; // If no H-index is found, return 0.
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Step 1: Bucket Creation**
    - Create an array `buckets` of size `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of papers. This array stores the count of papers with a specific number of citations.
    - For each citation count `c` in the `citations` array:
        - If `c` is greater than or equal to `n`, increment the `buckets[n]` (grouping all papers with `n` or more citations together).
        - Otherwise, increment the `buckets[c]`, which keeps track of how many papers have exactly `c` citations.

2. **Step 2: Traverse from Highest to Lowest Citations**
    - Start from the end of the `buckets` array, which represents the highest citation count.
    - Maintain a variable `h` to count how many papers have at least that many citations.
    - For each index `i` in the `buckets` array (from `n` down to `0`), check if `h >= i`. If true, this means there are at least `i` papers with at least `i` citations, and `i` is the H-index.

3. **Return the H-index**
    - The first time `h >= i` is met, `i` is returned as the H-index.
    - If no such `i` is found, return `0` (though this case is unlikely unless all citations are `0`).

### Time Complexity:

- **Time complexity:**
    - We traverse the `citations` array once to populate the `buckets` array (`O(n)`).
    - Then, we traverse the `buckets` array in reverse to compute the H-index (`O(n)`).
    - Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

- **Space complexity:**
    - We use an extra array `buckets` of size `n + 1`, so the space complexity is **O(n)**.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input array `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`:
- Step 1: Build the `buckets` array:
    - `buckets = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]`  
      (i.e., 1 paper has 0 citations, 1 paper has 1 citation, 0 papers have 2 citations, 1 paper has 3 citations, 0 papers have 4 citations, and 2 papers have 5 or more citations).

- Step 2: Traverse the buckets array from right to left:
    - Starting from `i = 5`: `h = 2`. Not enough papers (5 required), continue.
    - At `i = 4`: `h = 2`. Not enough papers (4 required), continue.
    - At `i = 3`: `h = 3`. Found enough papers (`h >= 3`), so return `3` as the H-index.

Thus, the H-index is `3`.

### Advantages of This Approach:
- **Time efficiency:** It avoids sorting, making it faster for large datasets.
- **Simplicity in logic:** It directly focuses on counting the necessary number of papers with at least a given number of citations without having to rearrange the data.

## **Self**
This code efficiently computes the **H-index** using a similar bucket counting approach, aiming for an optimal time complexity of `O(n)`. Let's break down the code step by step.

### Code Explanation:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int[] counts = new int[n+1]; // Step 1: Create a bucket array.

        // Step 2: Populate the buckets with citation counts.
        for (int c : citations) {
            counts[Math.min(c, n)]++;
        }

        int h = n; // Step 3: Start from the maximum possible H-index.
        int total = counts[n]; // Step 4: Initialize total with the number of papers with n or more citations.

        // Step 5: Decrease h until total >= h (condition for H-index).
        while (h > total) {
            h--; // Reduce h.
            total += counts[h]; // Accumulate the number of papers with h citations.
        }

        return h; // Return the computed H-index.
    }
}
```

### Key Steps:

1. **Step 1: Initialize the `counts` array**
    - The `counts` array of size `n + 1` is created, where `n` is the number of papers (i.e., the length of the `citations` array).
    - Each index in `counts` represents how many papers have that many citations. For example:
        - `counts[0]` represents the number of papers with 0 citations.
        - `counts[1]` represents the number of papers with 1 citation.
        - And so on, up to `counts[n]`, which represents the number of papers with `n` or more citations (since we only care about whether a paper has at least `n` citations).

2. **Step 2: Populate the `counts` array**
    - The loop `for (int c : citations)` iterates over each citation count `c` in the `citations` array.
    - For each citation count `c`, it increments the appropriate bucket:
        - If `c >= n` (more than `n` citations), we increment `counts[n]`.
        - Otherwise, we increment `counts[c]`.
    - The use of `Math.min(c, n)` ensures that all papers with `n` or more citations are grouped in `counts[n]`.

3. **Step 3: Set the initial value of `h`**
    - The variable `h` is initialized to `n`, as the maximum possible H-index for a person cannot exceed the total number of papers they have.

4. **Step 4: Initialize `total`**
    - The `total` variable is initialized to `counts[n]`, which represents the number of papers with `n` or more citations.

5. **Step 5: Decrease `h` while necessary**
    - The `while (h > total)` loop ensures that `h` is reduced until it meets the H-index condition: `h <= total`.
    - Inside the loop, `total += counts[h]` accumulates the number of papers with at least `h` citations. This ensures that we are counting all papers that can contribute to the H-index.
    - When `total >= h`, the loop terminates, and `h` represents the valid H-index.

6. **Return the H-index**
    - Once the loop finishes, `h` is returned as the H-index.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`:

1. **Step 1 and 2: Populate the `counts` array:**
    - Initialize `counts = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (size 6, since `n = 5`).
    - After processing each citation:
        - `citations[0] = 3` → `counts[3]++` → `counts = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
        - `citations[1] = 0` → `counts[0]++` → `counts = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
        - `citations[2] = 6` → `counts[5]++` → `counts = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]`
        - `citations[3] = 1` → `counts[1]++` → `counts = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`
        - `citations[4] = 5` → `counts[5]++` → `counts = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]`
    - Final `counts = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]`.

2. **Step 3: Initialize `h` and `total`**
    - `h = 5` (starting from the highest possible H-index).
    - `total = counts[5] = 2` (there are 2 papers with 5 or more citations).

3. **Step 5: Decrease `h` until `total >= h`:**
    - First iteration: `h = 5`, `total = 2` → `h > total`, so decrease `h`.
    - Second iteration: `h = 4`, `total = 2` → `h > total`, so decrease `h`.
    - Third iteration: `h = 3`, `total += counts[3] = 2 + 1 = 3` → Now, `total >= h`, so stop the loop.
    - H-index is `h = 3`.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time complexity:**
    - The loop that populates the `counts` array runs in `O(n)` since it processes each citation once.
    - The loop that checks and reduces `h` also runs in `O(n)` in the worst case.
    - Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

- **Space complexity:**
    - We use an additional `counts` array of size `n + 1`, so the space complexity is **O(n)**.

### Conclusion:

This version of the solution efficiently computes the H-index using a bucket sort approach with linear time complexity. The logic is simple and avoids the overhead of sorting the citations array. The algorithm ensures that `h` is reduced step by step while keeping track of the total number of papers that have at least `h` citations.
