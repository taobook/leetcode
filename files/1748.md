# 1748. Sum of Unique Elements | M-321 | v

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfUnique(int[] nums) {
        int[] counts = new int[100];
        for(int n : nums) counts[n-1]++;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<counts.length;i++){
            if(counts[i]==1) {
                res += i+1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

This code provides a solution to calculate the sum of unique numbers in an array `nums`, where a number is considered "unique" if it appears exactly once in the array. It uses a simple frequency count to identify these unique numbers.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Counting Element Frequencies**:
    - The solution uses an integer array `counts` of size 100 to store the frequency of each number in the input array `nums`. The assumption here is that the elements in `nums` range from 1 to 100 (based on the `counts[n-1]` indexing).

2. **Summing Unique Elements**:
    - After counting the frequency of each number, the algorithm iterates through the `counts` array. If a number appears exactly once (i.e., `counts[i] == 1`), it adds that number to the result.

### Code Breakdown:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfUnique(int[] nums) {
        int[] counts = new int[100];  // Array to count occurrences of numbers in `nums`
        
        // Step 1: Count the occurrences of each number in `nums`
        for (int n : nums) {
            counts[n - 1]++;
        }

        int res = 0;  // Variable to store the sum of unique numbers

        // Step 2: Iterate through the `counts` array and sum up unique numbers
        for (int i = 0; i < counts.length; i++) {
            if (counts[i] == 1) {
                res += i + 1;  // Add (i + 1) to the result since index i corresponds to the number (i + 1)
            }
        }

        return res;  // Return the sum of unique numbers
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Key Points:

1. **Step 1: Counting Occurrences in `nums`**:
    - The array `counts` is of size 100, and each index corresponds to a possible value from 1 to 100. For each number `n` in `nums`, the code increments the value at `counts[n - 1]`, which is the corresponding index for the number `n`.

2. **Step 2: Identifying and Summing Unique Numbers**:
    - After populating the `counts` array, the code iterates over it and checks for entries where the value is exactly `1`. These entries correspond to unique numbers, and the value `i + 1` (since the array is zero-indexed) is added to the result `res`.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the input:

```java
int[] nums = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5};
```

1. **Step 1: Count the Occurrences**:
    - After processing `nums = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5}`, the `counts` array will look like:
        - `counts = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, ...]`, where:
            - Index `0` corresponds to the number `1` (appears once),
            - Index `1` corresponds to the number `2` (appears twice),
            - Index `2` corresponds to the number `3` (appears once),
            - Index `3` corresponds to the number `4` (appears twice),
            - Index `4` corresponds to the number `5` (appears once).

2. **Step 2: Sum the Unique Numbers**:
    - The code will sum the numbers corresponding to indices where `counts[i] == 1`, which are:
        - Index `0` (`counts[0] == 1`): Add `1`.
        - Index `2` (`counts[2] == 1`): Add `3`.
        - Index `4` (`counts[4] == 1`): Add `5`.
    - The result is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The algorithm runs in linear time, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. The first loop counts the occurrences, and the second loop iterates over the fixed-size `counts` array (which has 100 elements).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant (`O(100) = O(1)`) because the size of the `counts` array is fixed, regardless of the input size. The space used is not dependent on the length of `nums`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **All Elements Are Unique**: If all elements in `nums` are unique, the result will be the sum of all elements. For example, `nums = {1, 2, 3}` results in `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

2. **No Unique Elements**: If no element appears exactly once, the result will be `0`. For example, `nums = {1, 1, 2, 2}` results in `0` since there are no unique elements.

3. **Empty Array**: If `nums` is empty, the result should be `0`.

### Optimizations:
While this approach is efficient, you could also use a `HashMap` to track frequencies. However, since the problem specifies that numbers range from 1 to 100, using a fixed-size array is more space-efficient and faster due to constant-time indexing.

### Conclusion:
This solution effectively computes the sum of unique elements in an array `nums` by counting the occurrences of each element and then summing those that appear exactly once. It is both time and space efficient given the problem constraints.
